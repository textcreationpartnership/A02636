            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing vvritten a confutation of a booke intituled <hi>An Apologie of the church of England,</hi> right excellent Princesse and my Soueraigne lady, for sundry causes I haue ben mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the same to make a present vnto your most excellent Maiestie. First, vvhereas that booke conteineth many great errours concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the necessary doctrine of faith, beside di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse vntruthes and slaunders touching sundry estates and persons, to no smal dishonour of our countrie and offence of godly and honest har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes: the same being both commonly preached in your realme and to the vvhole vvorld set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the vnder the name of the church of England: it semed to me conuenient, the confutation the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof be offered to that personage, to vvhom God hath geuen the rule and gouernement of England. Next, your learning and vvisedom being such as the world knovveth, I am persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that my trauail shal be vvell vnderstanded,
<pb facs="tcp:3928:3"/> and therfore right so accepted. Againe, your Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie being nolesse tryed in dede, then by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike fame to your great honour reported: there is no cause, vvhy the greatnes of your estate ought to feare the least of your louing subiectes to aduenter so holesome and so necessary an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise. Furthermore, your good inclination to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvardes the auncient and catholike religiō, vvhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch the authours of that Apologie vvith an odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous terme do call papistrie, encourageth me not a litle vnto your Maiestie to offer this gyft and seruice. Of vvhich your good inclination, (that I seme not to flatter) these both to me and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers appeare most euident argumentes. Your constant bearing and vpholding of the banner and enseigne of our redemption (the Image I meane of Christ crucified) against the enemies of his crosse: Your princely vvord cōmaunding a preacher, that opened his levvd mouth against the reuerent vse of the crosse in your priuate chappell, to retire from that vngodly digression vnto his text of holy scripture: Your vvell vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standed lyking of the sobrest preachers, both alvvayes heretofore, and specially on good fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day last openly by vvord of thankes declared, vvhen one of a more temperate nature then the rest, in his sermon before your Maiestie confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the real presence: Your gracious permission vnto your vvhole people to see, to heare, to haue,
<pb facs="tcp:3928:3"/> and to read the defences, and proufes of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith against the vnequall petitions of the contrary part: Your earnest zeale and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uail to bring (if it might be) those disordered ministers vnto some order of decent apparell, vvhich yet they vvant the reason tapply them selues vnto. To conclude, your aduised staye from hasty and sharp persecution, your quiet bearing of your svvord vvithin the scabard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so lovvdly cryed vpon of hote preachers to dravve it forth, the keping of your princely han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des pure and vnspotted, hauing ben so often and so earnestly solicited vvith bloud to haue embrued the same.</p>
            <p>These causes and argumentes haue moued me to dedicate this booke vnto your Maiestie. Neither haue I only herevvith ben moued thus to do, but also very many others your louing and faithfull subiectes ar vvith the same prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to conceiue comfort and hope of a better e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state for matters of religion to be sene in the church of England. For they trust that God vvho hath thus begonne, vvill happely bring all to good ende, and that, vvhereas he hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to stayd your Maiestie in this moderation vvhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch vve see, and holden backe your princely han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des from th'use of your svvorde against those of your subiectes, vvho stand in profession of the auncient and thuniuersall faith of all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb facs="tcp:3928:4"/> (from vvhich no terrour of svvorde can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue them): he vvill at length leade your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie to a deepe consideration of these vveighty matters touching theuerlasting health of mans soule, and vvith his holy spirite frame in you such firme persuasion and conscience, as by no colour of eloquence, or pretence of scripture by any of these nevve preachers vsed, you shall be induced to beleue that mutation of faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion may in any vvise be admitted, sith that the church hath not erred, nor lacked the holy ghost the spirite of truth, these nine hundred yeres past according to Christes promise, and to theffect of his prayer made to his father for that behalfe. This vvhen they call to mynde, vvhich they do very oftē, they ar prouoked to loue you, to thanke God of you, and to praye for you, that alvvayes you geue eare to his secrete motions, and imploye such rare and singular gyftes, as he hath most abundantly geuen you, to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to the defence of the catholike faith, to the maintenance of his church, to prefermēt of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, correction of vice, suppressiō of errours and heresies.</p>
            <p>Novv if your Maiestie vvill vouchesafe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad this Confutation, you shall see the crafty and vntrue dealinges of those vvho call them selues Gospellers, disclosed, their chiefe groundes ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throvven, their best proufes disproued, their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
<pb facs="tcp:3928:4"/> lyes detected, their sundry errours confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the truth declared, and the partes of that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine proued true, vvhich the holy ghost hath taught and continevved in the church these nine hundred yeres, vvhich the authours of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie condemne for a time of blindnes, ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, superstition, and idolatrie, for a time in vvhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che (as they saye) the gospell failed, the light of Gods vvord vvas put out, the fonteines of the vvater of lyfe vvere quite dryed vp. In vvhich Confutation albeit much lesse is said (I graunt) vnto euery point, then might be said by men of greater learning, and much lesse also then my selfe could saye in a larger volume vvith longer time: yet ynough (I am assured) shall be founde therein to proue them deceiued and deceiuers, false teachers, lyers, backebiters, and slaunderers. So that, if in so small a booke as that is, they shal be founde to haue vttered no small number of errours, lyes, and slaunders: your excellent vvise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom may thereof iudge, vvhat store of such stuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe is lyke to be founde in the vvhole lumpe of their nevve diuinitie.</p>
            <p>In this doing if I shall seme to any ouer bolde and presumptuous, thexamples of good men may serue for mine excuse, folovving herein the steppes of sundry learned and holy fathers, that in this path haue trod me the trace, vvhose boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes to their studie, or penne and yncke to their
<pb facs="tcp:3928:5"/> paper, I vvish my selfe vvere vvorthy to beare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them. For it is no nevv thing most gracious Soueraigne, learned men to dedicate their vvri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges to Princes and great estates. And vvheras it vvere easy to name many of the primitiue church, as the blessed martyr S. Iustine, Apolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naris, Apollonius, Quadratus, Aristides and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that gaue their bookes vvritten in defence of our Christian faith to the Romaine Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and likevvise sundry others, vvho dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their defences of the catholike faith against the Arians to other Princes: those passed ouer vvith silence, here the rehersall of tvvo, vvho pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented their bookes to noble Quenes, is most conuenient to my purpose. Cyrill that famous learned bishop of Alexādria, dedicated a booke, vvhich he had vvritten of the catholike faith, specially against the heresie of Nestorius, to Quenes, that is to saye, to the vvife and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Theodosius the yonger, Emperour. Atticus bishop of Constantinople, vvrote a boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke to the noble christian Quenes the daughters of Arcadius the Emperour, in vvhich he impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the heresie also of Nestorius. Novv if those learned and holy fathers offered their bookes vvritten in defence of Christiā faith against pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimes and against heretikes to Romaine Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to christian Kinges, and also to noble Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: vvhat reason can be pretēded, vvhy I should
<pb facs="tcp:3928:5"/> not offer my booke conteining a defence of the same faith against errours and heresies, to your Maiestie being a Princesse of so good inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of so tried and famous Clemēcie, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvise of most noble and princely disposition?</p>
            <p>Yea though no other reason ne argument to ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke this enterprise moued me, to vvhom may the subiect so duly dedicate his labours, as to his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne dere lady and Prince? Or vvhere should truth almost smothered and oppressed seeke succour and defence, but vnder the name and protectiō of such, as through Gods dispensation by gyft of singular vvitte be inuited, and as it vvere lead by the hand to vnderstand it, by rare goodnes of nature to loue it, by sufficient habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to defend it?</p>
            <p>Accept therfore most gracious Princesse I hū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly prostrate besech your excellēt Maiestie, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se my rude labours in fauorable part, and geue thē thestimatiō that the truth of the cause, that my faithfull dutie, that my seruiceable hart to your Maiestie, and not that the simple vtterance and smal learning of the vvorke deserueth. Also vnto the singular goodnes of God, vvhose great prouidence that ruleth all, hath appointed your Maiestie to gouerne in the vvorld at this tyme, reserue and yelde continually (as you haue done) your hart, your eares, your eyes euer open and free, to vnderstand, to heare, and to see his truth,
<pb facs="tcp:3928:6"/> And as an vsurie for your rare and singular giftes receiued at his hand, restore and bring vnto him (for his loue I as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e it) but the applying and ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of your singular vvisedom and deepe consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration vnto the roote and ground, frō vvhence these straunge doctrines grevve, vnto the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se and meanes vvith vvhich they be mainteined and supported, vnto the fruit and successe that euery vvhere they hatch and bring forth: and by this litle said by me, consider vvith all, vvhat and hovv much might be said against euery part of it. And finding the roote nought els but co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueteousnes, ambition, malice, and carnal libertie, the shores and pillours that vphold it, but lyes and falsehed, vvrong and crafty argumentes, the fruites none other but first, ruyne and spoile, thē sedition and rebellion vvhere it is resisted, and therevvith furthermore robbery, sacrilege, and horrible murder, then finally such confusion of opinions and infinite varietie of doctrines, as breedeth in the people a mere paganisme, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish loosnes, and a very Epicurian atheisme, vvhere it is let runne: And perceiuing vvith all, (as I doubt not but you shall) hovv litle true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, substantiall learning, or effectuall argument there is to proue the particulers of it, the body and substance of these doctrines being founde to be but such a lumpe of vntruthes in dede, as your Maiesties great iudgement attending it can

To saye the trouth, the zeale of God it is, that chiefly hath dryuen me to take the penne in hande, and I trust his good spirite hath directed the same. verely that so it might be, my prayer hath not wanted. VVhether this zeale hath ben according to knowledge (without which it might be myslyked) or otherwise: I offer it to be tryed by such mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes as tryall may be made.<note place="margin">Triall of skillefull zeale.</note> Let both writinges be layd in balance, first, so much as concerneth the doctrine of faith, to be weighed with the weightes of the generall and aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent custome of the people of God, which in such case by the mynde of saint Augustine is to be taken for a lawe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of the olde learned fathers, of approued councels, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the holy scriptures, so as the catholike church hath euer vnderstanded them,<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:3928:8"/> Authours of the Apologie mencioned, let all be tried by the weightes of true histories. Thirdly, what thinges they alleage as out of the fathers, councels, chroniclers, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonistes, and scoole men: for triall of the truth I referre all to due examination of bookes, out of which ech thing is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged. This done, if they shall be founde to haue vsed false weightes, and appeare ouer light in the balance, as neither hauing the iust poys of the scriptures, councels, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or custome for their doctrine of faith, nor of histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for maners and actes by them spoken of, nor of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther allegations brought for proufe of other thinges: I doubt not but in the iudgement of all godly and wise men my zeale shall seme right and iust, as not being altogether besides knowledge.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">VVhat is here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.</note>But what if it be euidently shewed, that these men haue not only failed in proufe of thinges they tooke in hand to proue, but also haue done contrary to reason, shamefastnes, and common honestie, and haue stuffed their booke with shameles lyes in generall, with scoffes, railinges, and slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders touching both the persons of certaine speciall men, and states and degrees in common, with false doctrines, errours, and heresies touching the scriptures, with prophane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt touching the most holy sacramentes, with haynous blasphemie touching God him selfe? In this case I trust my zeale shall not only be acquited of all blame, but also shal excuse the silence of others of my calling, who at length should greuously haue ben accused, if none for loue of truth
<pb facs="tcp:3928:8"/> had brought to light those thinges, which so much it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth men vpon in these perrilous tymes to vnderstand. That in this confutation this much is shewed and proued to the vtter discredite of the Apologie, thy selfe wilt so iudge Reader, if thou vouchesafe aduisedly to read it ouer.</p>
            <p>Myne intent hath ben only to shewe the truth,<note place="margin">Intent.</note> and to remoue men from the manyfold and crafty deceit of lying, which is the dutie partly of euery man, so farre as the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of charitie reacheth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccl.</hi> 17.</note> and so farre as by God to ech one charge of his neighbour is committed: but specially of those who haue bestowed their time in studie to thende to teach others the truth, and by laufull calling haue ben appointed therunto.</p>
            <p>The ende I looke for of all my labour is,<note place="margin">Ende.</note> that the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies being confuted, lyes detected, slaunders wyped awaye, wherwith the Apologie is farced: the catholike faith which in these dayes is so much impugned, may be defended, the truth embraced, the church duely regarded, that of our dere coūtrie men, they which through gods grace stād, by reading this confutation may be animated to kepe their standing, they which stomble and slyde, may fynde wherwith to staye them, they which be fallen, may be admonished how to rise againe,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.</note> and recouer them selues from the snares of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, of whom they are holden captiue at his will.</p>
            <p>The manner of writing which I haue here vsed,<note place="margin">Manner of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of our aduersaries is sober, softe, and gentle, yet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hementer, rougher, and sharper, then for my wont and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
<pb facs="tcp:3928:9"/> but in respect of their heate, bitternes, and railing, as many tell me, ouer colde, swete, and mylde. How so euer it shall seme to thee Reader, herein I haue done as I thought best. VVell I am assured I haue not gone farre from the steppes of the most praised auncient fathers, of whom who haue bene commended most for the spirite of meekenes, the same, though toward other offenders haue shewed them selues like mylde Moyses, yet hauing to do with heretikes, commonly haue demeaned them selues like earnest Elias. If lyers should be entreated in like sorte as true reporters, slaunderers and backebyters, as faithfull frendes, hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, as catholikes, Apostates, as stedfast christians, bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemers, as saintes: truth should be iniured, wickednes flattered, vertue misprised. Of whom the truth was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned or resisted with malice, them litle spared either the prophetes, or the Apostles, or Christ him selfe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Order.</note>The order that I thought good to kepe is this. First, (as thou mayst here see) I haue put the wordes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie as I found them translated, sometimes by whole para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphes, sometimes by mo, sometimes by fewer and briefe sentences, according to the dependence or weight of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Then foloweth my confutation longer or shorter, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the thing confuted. Here shalt thou finde the Apologie whole, sentence for sentence, word for word. That I might seme to deale vprightly, I would leaue out nothing. And least it should be layd to me, that I had pyked out cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine pointes to refell, and left sundry other vntouched, as
<pb facs="tcp:3928:9"/> acknowleged, and confessed for good and true: auoiding thobiection of parciall dealing, and of approuing that which is to be condemned: making their booke no worse then it is, I haue here set forth, and after my manner confuted the whole, not so as I would ech sentence to be numbred, but rather to be weighed. In weight I trust none shalbe fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unde vnrefelled, though in number some fewe for lacke of pith be either sleightly touched, or quite past ouer, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of time and labour bestowed about them.</p>
            <p>All this haue I done so briefly as I could, yet hath my booke growen to a farre more largenes, then I would. For breuities sake many pointes I haue with fewe wordes trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which fully to be discussed, would by them selues requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re large treatises. But what should I do? Verelie this Apologie is such a peece of worke, as for euery heresie, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry slaunder, euery lye, briefly euery false point and part of it to be fully and thoroughly confuted and aunswered, and the contrary truth to be declared and set forth: it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire many great volumes, and a whole mans life, wherein for my part beside the time of printing, I haue not bestowed fully three quarters of a yere. The more thy gentlenes ought to beare with me, if euery point be not founde aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to thy expectation.</p>
            <p>The authour of the Apologie,<note place="margin">The stuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe of the Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie.</note> if it were made by any one, and not by many heades, as it is most likely: what so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he could finde in the bookes of those late writers, who haue diuided themselues from the obedience of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb facs="tcp:3928:10"/> church, either concerning doctrine or manners written against the catholike faith, which they cal Papistrie, against the churh, against the Bishops of Rome, against the whole clergy: the same hath he raked together, and thrust it into the Apologie. That there was neuer booke made, which in so litle rome conteined so great a heape of lyes, errours, heresies, tauntes, scoffes, vpbraidinges, slaunders, rancours, and bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemies. Such is the booke, and for such it is estemed out of England of all wise and learned men. And fewe haue yet ben sounde, which could finde in their hartes to put the pēne to paper against it, not for that they could not, or durst not, but for that they liked not to bestowe their study in such argument, as that, which they abhorre for the multitude of shameles lyes, for the vaine and light scoffes, for the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious slaunderinges of men by name, for the vnhonest disclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of fylthy matters, which chaste eares would be loth to heare, for the horriblenes of heresies, and for such other lothsom thinges sauering altogether of the spirite of Satan.</p>

               <note place="margin">VVriters against the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie.</note>Two onely I heare of that haue written against it, the one in latin, a learned Spaniard, bishop in the kingdom of Naples, the other an Italian, in the Italian tonge. Both bookes are staied from print and setting abroade as it is thought, in regard of our countrie. VVhose honour should be ouer much touched, if the whole church of the realme were so openly charged with thapprouing of such a lying, vndiscrete, vnreasonable, slaunderous and vngodly writting. For which cause my selfe thought it more conuenient,<note place="margin">For what cause this Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was written in English rather then in Latine.</note> to
<pb facs="tcp:3928:10"/> write this Confutation in english, then in latin, that so both falsehed might be refelled, and truth defended, and also that our domesticall faultes might be considered to amendment within the bankes of England, and not by the common tonge blowen abroade through all Christendom, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and shame of our countrie.</p>
            <p>VVhereas a certaine learned man of our owne countrie, one of good accōpt, in his answere to the epistle which Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronymus Osorius of godly zeale, with due modestie, rype dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and singular eloquence wrote to the Quenes Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, referreth that famous man for proufe and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Religion of our countrie, and for the whole real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes vniforme agreeing in the same, to the Apologie set forth (as he saith) by the church of England openly to the eyes of all the world, as a common and an assured pledge of our Religion, and there eggingly requireth him to refell it, if he be able, affirming very preiudicially that neither he, nor any other of his syde is able, (wherby he excludeth all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like men be they neuer so well learned): I feare me to wise men that will seme rather of courage a stout shewe, then of truth a substantiall proufe. Neither in my iudgement the same becommeth his person and his sundry vertues, how so euer it becommeth so feeble a cause to be set forth with a lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty brauarie of wordes. As for all others besides Osorius, whether any be able to refell it or no, let tyme trye. But how so euer that famous Bishop be either yet able, or shall at any time be willing, thou hast here gentle Reader, in the
<pb facs="tcp:3928:11"/> meane time a confutation of that booke, and the thing done, which hath bene so stoutly affirmed, no man of Osorius side, that is to say, none that is Catholike, is able to do, and that not by a Portugall of which countrie Osorius is, but by one of thyne owne countrie. Of my ablenes what shall I saye? Therof my selfe holding silence, the thing speaketh. Truly I acknowledge it to be very small. And for that I do so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, I thanke God nolesse, then for the measure the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof it selfe, which he hath geuen to me, I haue not geuen to my selfe.<note place="margin">The good will of thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</note> And all this hast thou with so good a wil Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to raise thee vp that art fallen, to staie thee that art wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering, to moue thee to be stedfast, that standest, briefly to comfort thee, and by all meanes to do thee good, what case, mynde, or affection so euer thou findest thy selfe in: as cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to my neighbour, loue to my countrie, dutie to God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.</p>

I thought best to folowe the order of writing that a confutation requireth. And although I write against them, who call their booke a defence, (for so the greke word signifieth) and I therfore name them defenders: yet in respect of my purpose, which is to defend the truth, I take my selfe in dede for the defendāt, them for the chalengers. Neither for all this, if thou marke well what is here said, shalt thou finde onely falsehed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sproued, but also in most pointes of faith the truth suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently (and so farre as the nature of a confutation bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth) declared and proued.</p>

For somuch importeth your word subornate in Latine. And if ye had named those whom he hath wylely subornated, your tale had the lesse smelled of a slaunderous lye.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Novv as for those thinges vvhich by them haue been layed against vs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apologie.</note>
                     <hi>in part they be manifestly false &amp; condempned so by their ovvne iudgementes vvhiche spake them, partly again, though they be as false to in deede, yet beare they a certain shevv and colour of truth, so as the Reader (if he take not good hede) may easily be tripped and brougt into errour by them, specially vvhen their fine and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge tale is added thereunto: and part of them be of suche sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, as vvee oughte not to shunne them as crimes or faultes, but to acknovvledg and professe them as thinges vvell done, and vpon
<pb facs="tcp:3928:23"/> very good reason.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>If ye had here vttered any particular and special pointes, ye should haue heard particular answere. Now that ye speake in general, take ye this for an answere generall. First what thinges the catholikes moued with very cōscience and loue of truth laye against you, they are true, as it shal be manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proued, when ye bring vs to your specialties. Neither bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den they you with ought, wherein by their owne iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes they condemne them selues, as ye slaunder them not only here, but oftentimes in your booke. For if they iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged otherwise, they would not wittingly do against their iudgement. That is the speciall propertie of an heretike, whom.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.</note> S. Paul biddeth all men to auoyde, <hi>knowing that he that is such, is peruerted, an synneth euen condemned by his owne iudgement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Neither is there lesse truth in the writinges of certaine catholike men, wherein they shewe both your blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous heresies and your wicked actes, because their vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is fine and cunning. For truth maye be tolde finely, and falsehed grossely. Luther ye knowe powred out his he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies and villanies against king Henry the eight rudely, and a lerned catholike of England bearing the name of Rossaeus answered him cunningly.<note place="margin">Rossaeus.</note> Hereof (if nede were) we could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite other examples ynough.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, whereas certaine thinges against your side obiected by the catholikes, ye do not onely not shunne as crimes and faultes, but also acknowledge and vpholde as well done: If ye meane your robbing of churches, persecuting of men for standing stedfastly in the faith of the holy forefathers, your incestuous mariagies of monkes, friers, and Nonnes, your breach of solemne vowes for fleshly pleasure, your propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and abandoning of holy sacramentes, your contempt of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3928:23"/> auncient and godly ordinances and discipline of the church, and such other thinges of like estimation: then shewe ye your selues to be of that sorte against whom our Lord thundereth out his terrible <hi>Vae</hi> by the prophete Esaie.<note place="margin">

                     <note place="margin">Apologie.</note>
                     <hi>these folke falsely accuse and slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all oure doinges: yea the same thinges vvhiche they them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues can not deny but to be rightly and orderly don, and for malice do so misconstre and depraue all our sayinges and doinges, as thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe it vvere impossible, that any thinge could be rightly spoken or don by vs. They should more plainly and sincerely haue gone to vvorke if they vvould haue dealt truely, but novv they neither tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie nor sincerelye: nor yet Christianly, but darklye and craftely char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge and batter vs vvith lies, and doe abuse the blindenes and fonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the people, together vvith the ignoraunce of Princes, to cause vs to be hated, and the truth to be suppressed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ye saye the truth so shortly,<note place="margin">Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that ye haue all saied and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, before ye saye euer a true word. How falsely the catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes accuse and slaunder your doinges, hereafter ye go about to shewe. To those places we differre our answere.<note place="margin">The first part of the Apolog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>This, lo ye, is the povver of darkenes and of men,</hi>

But vve giue thankes to the most good and mighty God, that such is our cause, vvhere against (vvhen they vvoulde fainest) they vvere able to vtter no dispite, but the same

                     <note place="margin">Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>Yet ye ioyne not, but kepe your selues aloosse of. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye reach not home. These sore blowes do but stricke the ayer, and only cause a whizzing noyes. To all that ye saye here, if we said all were false: ye were truly answered. Truth standeth not in your wordes, but in thinges as they be. Ye were not best to vaunt your selues somuch, lest wise men thinke, your trumpet soundeth triumphe before the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie. Lerned men of the catholike church haue truly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged you with haynous heresies, and great enormities of life, committed by the pretenced libertie of your gospell, which here is not their place to reherse. Of the same to saye, that they may as well be wrested against the fathers, Prophetes, Apostles,<note place="margin">A long talke of a matter nedeles. A briefe recitall of thinges hitherto said in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie.</note> and Christ him selfe, were extreme blasphemie. Thus hitherto ye haue done nothing els, but vttered a long talke for proufe of that no man denieth. First, that truth is persecuted, next, that your selues are persecuted. Wherein ye neded not to bestow so many wordes. For in dede the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes do persecute you, (if such deserued entreating of euill persons may be called persecution) and all good folke besides, we graunt, and shall so do, so long as they loue the truth, and kepe them in the vnitie of the church.

Humble your hartes, consider from whence ye are fallen, repent and returne, forsake your heresies, embrace the catholike faith, and come againe to the church: they will persecute you no more, but receiue you, loue you, and honour you like members of one bodie.

For although other vvronges, yea of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes great, may be borne and dissembled of a milde and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian man, yet he that goeth smothelye avvaie and dissembleth the matter vvhen he is noted of heresie, Ruffinus vvas vvont to deny that man to be a Christian.

And this is the chiefe argument ye make in in all that huge dongehill of your stinking martyrs, which ye haue intituled Actes and monumentes.) But we tell you. It is not death that iustifieth the cause of dying. But it is the cause of dying that iustifieth the death. He that dieth for maintenance of a good cause, is blessed. He that dieth for an euil dede, suffereth his deserued punishment.

                  <p>Princes (ye saye) were desirous, to restraine your gospell, and though they went about it by many waies, yet preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led they nothing.

For princes be desiderous to kepe their dominions from robbing, and haue euer deuised straight lawes and punishmentes for restraint of theues: yet be theues euery where, and theft is daily committed. Then by your lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gike what shall a man saye to it, but that theues are of such a vocation, as God is pleased withall, and which he will haue to continewe and prosper?

<pb facs="tcp:3928:27"/> grounde will be weedy, be it neuer so diligently weeded. But generally the more it is ridde of weedes, the cleaner it proueth. Catholike princes haue in some countries sought wayes to restraine your heresies. Yet were not those coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries thereby wholly purged, such is the infection of that euill. And where as your gospell,<note place="margin">This car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell sone taketh place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mōg car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.

Yet where the princes haue vsed most diligence and best meanes to stoppe the course of your heresies, there the people remaine most catholike. As euery man maye iudge by vewe of Italy, Spai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, base Almaine, and Fraunce, before that weighty sceptre by Gods secrete prouidence for punishement of synne, was committed to feble handes, that for tender age were not able to beare it.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3928:31"/> for the king of the Iland Bacian, who whas Christened in the yere 1558. Lastly for the foure kinges baptized in the rich countrie of Macazar by the holy father Vincētius Viegas. For certaine knowledge of this and of much more the like ioyfull matter, we haue the true certificate made by the sayd holy fathers of the societie of Iesus translated out of the spanish into the Italian tonge with notice of all the circumstances set forth in print, which euery man that vnderstandeth that tong may read to his great comfort.</p>
                  <p>Least our aduersaries should charge vs with vntruth, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the aboue mencioned countries, we meane not that the whole said countries be conuerted to the faith as yet, for then were christendom by many partes more there, then it is here, but that in euery of them great numbers of people be christened. And how much the faith increaceth there yere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and daily, coniecture may be gathered by that is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely knowen to haue ben done of late yeres in Goa a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie placed in the east part of the world,<note place="margin">Goa is novv vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the King of Portugal.</note> not farre from Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut. Where first in the yere of our Lord 1556, were christe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned 42, persons: in the next yere 1557, of all sortes 1080: in the yere 1558, a thousand nine hundred and sixtene: in the yere folowing, 3260: and in the yere 1560, there were christened twelue thousand seuen hundred two and forty persons.</p>
                  <p>If ye dare saye, your so many free cities, so many kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, be not mad, that haue forsaken the faith professed in the church of Rome, wherein ye saye not truly: how much more may we saye, blessed be the name of God, who hath called to the confession and knowledge of his holy name so great numbres of infidels by preaching of that doctrine which ye detest and abhorre? What so euer your scoffing sprite wil report of these peoples cōuerted to the faith at the same time as ye peruerted and tourned from the faith your
<pb facs="tcp:3928:32"/> so many free Cities, though ye call them mad, simple, or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant: verely the miracles by those holy fathers which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted them through Gods power wrought, and that speciall grace of the holy ghost, I trowe ye will not accompt to be madnes. Thus your vaine boast in wickednes wrought by the power of Sathan, is put to silence with our true ioye powred into our hartes for so great abundance of the grace of God wrought by the holy ghost in the conuersion of so many soules which had not heard of Christ before.</p>

Your second cause is false, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after it shall be shewed. Your first is naught, as that which sheweth your pride, vaine glorie, and pertinacie. For hauing mainteined sundry heresies (as hereafter it shall be proued) it had ben rather your dutie by speaking to confesse your fault, then so to speake, as whereby ye maye seme to graunt no fault. To haue acknouledged your fault, it had ben a vertue. Now thus to speake in defence of your fault, it is a doubling of your fault. Well, ye do but as heretikes before you haue euer done. It must not be looked for at your handes, that ye acknowledge any fault. For that were humilitie, which ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue all heretikes be farre from.</p>
                  <p>Ye seme to be offended with the custom of generall councels, because thereby ye be not admitted to geue your voice or declare your opinion.<note place="margin">In coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels any man may shevve his opinion, but none may geue a voice, or suffrage, and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitiue, but only bishops.</note> To declare his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in certaine cases at a generall councell any man may

But to geue a voice or suffrage, and to vtter sentence definitiue, it perteineth only to bishops, because to them specially belongeth iurisdiction, power to binde and loose, and the gouernement of churches. Now ye being no bishops, but some of you mere laie men, and most of you Apostates, ye must content your selues, if ye be iustly restrained from that, which is aboue the degree of your vocation.</p>

By you if there were any in our forefathers dayes, which complained of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and desired true religion to be restored: then was there in your opinion some light pardy, the gospell then was not first preached by Luther and Zuinglius. Well, would God this ouersight were the worst point in your doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Were it true that Christ was called a Samaritane for the cause ye assigne, thereof what conclude ye? we see where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ye go.

<pb facs="tcp:3928:38"/> and those persecuted christians of the primitiue church. But we tell you, Christ was the true Samaritane in dede, that is to saye,<note place="margin">Samaritā.</note> the keper, as he that is keper of mankinde, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he shunned not the name. Yet was he not a Samaritane as the Iewes meant.<note place="margin">Iohn. 8.</note> Paul likewise, (who was not as ye saye to speake properly called before the iudges to make answere to a matter of heresie) being accused to Felix by Tertullus that he was of the secte or heresie of the Nazarens (so were the christians first called) did not only not denye,<note place="margin">Act. 24.</note> but openly confessed, that according to that waye or state of life, which the Iewes called a sect or heresie, he worsshipped God. For it is to be considered that in those times the name of heresie<note place="margin">Heresie.</note> was not so infamous, as it may be iudged by the place of the actes cap. 5, onlesse somewhat be added whereby it maye be vnderstanded to be taken in rate of a vice, as, 1.

Ye are called heretikes, worthely. Paul burdened with the name of heresie, for asmuch as thereby was signified the kinde of life of those that beleued in Christ, the word being indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, was honoured rather then reuiled.

                  <p>Concerning this place of S. Augustine, it ought not to be stretched to all matters in generall, that be in question, as though we might not vse the testimonies and aucthorities of the fathers against heretikes: but it perteineth only to the question in that booke <hi>de vnitate Ecclesiae</hi> treated of, which is, where the church is. Petilian the Donatist and the maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of that heresie contended the church to be only in Aphrike, or at the furthest <hi>in parte Donati,</hi> among them only that helde with Donatus. The same heresie went they about to proue by scriptures. But when S. Augustine sawe how weake their proufes were, which they brought out of the scriptures, he prouoked them, the better to euerthrow them, to come to the triall of the scriptures. And in dede where the scriptures be manifest for proufe of any matter, what nede is there of doctours?<note place="margin">VVhere thexposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers be necessary, Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the fathers.</note> But where the sense of the scriptures is obscure, and may be wrested by euill wittes to the maintenaunce of an heresie: there the expositions of the fathers by all olde writers haue ben taken of necessitie to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3928:42"/> supplie the scriptures obscuritie, and to declare the sense of the church, which the holy ghost hath prompted. And in such cases S.

Where beside scripture touching originall synne, he allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth against the Pelagians a great number of fathers, and at length in one place speaking of thauctoritie, reuerence, and credite he had them in, he sayeth thus. <hi>Quod credunt, credo:</hi>

For head and spouse alone he is in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, not alone in an other respect. For a cleare declaration whereof it is to be vnderstanded, that being of a head may be considered after two wayes, either according to the inward influence, so as the vertue and power of mouing and of sense is deriued from the head vnto the other members: or accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to outward gouernemēt, right so a as mā is directed in his outward actes according to the sight and other senses,<note place="margin">Accordīg to invvard influence of grace Christ onely is head of the church</note> which haue their roote in the head. Now the inward influence of grace is not of any other, but of Christ only. Because christes manhood only hath power to iustifie, for that the same only is ioyned personally to the Godhed. According to this inward influēce of grace, Christ properly and only is head of his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical body the church.<note place="margin">In respect of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the name of head is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to others beside Christ. <hi>Amos.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 15. <hi>Psal.</hi> 17. Headship in respect of gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement diuerse in Christ and in mē</note> But as touching the outward gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement, the being of a head is commō to Christ with others. For in this respect certaine others may be called heads of the church, as in Amos the prophete the great states be called <hi>the heads of the people.</hi> So the scripture speaketh of king Saul, <hi>When thou were a litle one in thine own eyes, thou wast made head among the tribes of Israel.</hi> So <hi>Dauid</hi> sayeth of him selfe, <hi>he hath made me head of nations.</hi> In this sense the name of head is attributed to princes and gouernours. And yet not all together so as to Christ. First forasmuch as Christ is head of all those that perteine to the church, according to euery place, euery time, and euery state. But men are called heads in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of certaine speciall places, as bisshops be called heades of their churches. Or in respect of a determinat time, as the Pope is head of the whole church, during the time of that calling. And according to a determinat state, euen
<pb facs="tcp:3928:57"/> so as men be in the state of this mortall life, for further stretcheth not this humaine headship. Againe the name of head is attributed to Christ an other waye, because Christ is head of the church by his owne power and auctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Men be called heads, in asmuch as they be in stede of Christ and vnder Christ, after which meaning S. Paul sayeth to the Corinthians,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.</note>

This being graunted, as in euery speciall number of Christes people being aparte one pastor and one bishop is requisite to be the ruler of them all: so what reason is it there be not one chiefe Gouernour of the whole Christen people together?

For whereas the Father hath geuen to Christ all power in heauen and earth, so as he only is the king, head, ruler, iudge of all, <hi>the pastour and bishop of our soules,</hi> and therefor they which we acknowledge to be kinges, heads, rulers, iudges, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours,
<pb facs="tcp:3928:59"/> and bishops in earth, be his vicares, lieutenantes, vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerentes, and ministers: all this power by what name so euer it be called,<note place="margin">A man is necessary to do Christes stede of outvvard gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the church. The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie and insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the head of the church. <hi>Genes.</hi> 32. <hi>Num.</hi> 12. <hi>Luc.</hi> 1. <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</note> being such as is exercised and administred by his word: nede it is that forasmuch as Christ now dwelleth not with vs in visible presence, his church haue one man to do his stede of outward ruling in earth, by his word to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister all that is behooful, and to performe the dutie of the head in respect of the bodie.</p>
                  <p>Now that Christ is not conuersant with vs visibly, as he was with his disciples before his passion, and preacheth no more vnto vs with his owne mouth sensibly, to atteine the vnderstanding of his will we may not looke to haue God appere vnto vs as he dyd to the fathers of the olde Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēt, to speake to vs, as he dyd to Moses face to face, mouth to mouth, as the scripture saith, to send vs his angell, as he dyd to the virgine Marie, to enstruct vs with visions from heauen, as he instructed Peter, to take vs vp into the third heauen, as he tooke Paul, there to heare the secrets of his will: but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth vs to be content for the working of that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth to be done touching our saluation, with such order as hath pleased him. For it is manifest that Christ perfiteth all the Sacramentes of the church. He it is that baptizeth, he it is that forgeueth synnes, he is the true priest that hath offered him selfe on the crosse, and by whose power his body is daily consecrated and offered on the aulter. Yet because he would not remaine in visible presence with all beleuers, he chose men to be his ministers, by whom the forsayd thinges shuld be done and ministred to them. By like reason forasmuch as he would take from the church his corporall and visible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, it behoued some one man to be put in commission for bearing the charge and taking care of the church in lieu and stede of him selfe. For this purpose before his Ascension he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:3928:59"/> said to Peter, whose loue he had tryed and fownde to be most feruent aboue all others, <hi>Fede my shepe.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohan.</hi> 21.</note> And before his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>Thou being againe conuerted strengthen thy brethren.</hi>

                        <hi>Luc.</hi> 2. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.</note> And to him specially he sayd by promyse, <hi>To thee will I geue the keies of the kingdom of heauen,</hi> thereby to shew, that the power of the keyes shuld be deriued to others by him for the better keping of the vnitie of the church.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see these Defenders negatiue doctrine,<note place="margin">The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders argumēts made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vnitie auoided.</note> that no one man may haue the superioritie ouer the whole state of the church, disproued as vtterly false. But now let vs see what weighty reasons they bring for the same. Their reasons be these. First because Christ is euer present to assist his church, secondly because he nedeth not any man to supply his rome as his only heire to all his substance, thirdly because no man is able to comprehend in his mynde the vniuersal church: therefor there is no man head of the church. I maruell that they who be so captious to finde fault and scoffe at other mens reasons, make so slēder reasons them selues. <note place="margin" type="runSum">1</note>For answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to the first. Though Christ by maiestie of his godhed be present euery where, for so he filleth heauen and earth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ierem.</hi> 23.</note> and by speciall grace be present to assist his church,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.</note> as he doth assist euery faithfull man: yet because the church is a body politike, visible and sensible, and is gathered together, of men who lyuing in flesh, and fighting against the flesh,<note place="margin">The go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēt of the church requireth a sensible man.</note> consist of body and soule, of flesh and spirite, and not of spirite only: it is to be gouerned by a sensible man, whom it may see and heare, whose visible ministerie it may perceiue and obeye in stede of Christ. The ministerie of which man Christ vseth to this purpose, and by the same doth his worke, as a craftesman to do his worke vseth his instrument. If men consisted of spirite only, they shuld nede none other gouernour then Christ alwayes by the grace of his holy spirite assisting them. Now
<pb facs="tcp:3928:60"/> being of body and spirite, it behoueth they be gouerned by a man like them selues. For els if it were laufull euery man for vpholding of all his doinges to pretend that he folowed the mocion of Christes spirite, what rule would be in the church, it is easy to conceiue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin" type="runSum">2</note>Touching their second reason, we graunt, Christ nedeth not any man to supply his rome that should succede in his whole substance, for so hath the Latin. For neither is man of capacitie of such succession, nor Christ geueth awaye all his substance,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Esai.</hi> 24.</note> as neither his glorie to an other. Neither hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any such fond saying ben vttered by the diuines where they treate of the vnitie of the churches regiment. But it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth this Defender here regarded more the prety elegancie of the law phrase, then the weight of the matter. But foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he speaketh of nede, we saye, first, that Christ nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not, but that men haue nede, so it be. Christ is able by him selfe to gouerne, but man is not able to receiue the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite thereof.<note place="margin">Nede, hovv it may be at tributed to Christ.</note> The weaknes is of mans part, not of Christes. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine we saye that nede is double, absolute and with condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. Nede absoute neither is nor can be in Christ. For being God omnipotent he nedeth nothing so absolutely. Nede with condicion Christ may haue his honour not impaired. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was forepurposed by God, and so forespoken by his Prophete Zacharie, that Chist the king of Iewes shuld come to them in meeknes and humilitie, sitting on an Asse and on the fole of an asse vsed to the yoke:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. <hi>Zachar.</hi> 9.</note> sending two of his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples for the same to the place where they were tied, he cōma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unded them, if ought were sayd to them why they so did, to answer <hi>quia dominus his opus habet,</hi> that the Lord had nede of them. And therein he bad them not to lye. So because the wil and wisdom of God hath determined, that Christ hauing performed the whole oeconomie of his incarnation, that is,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:3928:60"/> all that he came to do for mankinde in flesh: his church after taking his visible presence from earth shuld be gouerned by men, who shuld be ambassadours for him in the world, who shuld be interpreters and declarers of his secrete will, finally who shuld represent his person to the beleuers: to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this he hath nede of men. And because he sawe the knotte of vnitie shuld most surely be kept knitte by gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement of one, he committed the regiment of the whole church to one, whose visible ministerie he might vse in stede of him selfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin" type="runSum">3</note>To their third reason we saye affirming that which they denie. That a man is not only able to comprehend in his mind and conceiue the vniuersall church, but also to put it in order and to gouerne it, so farre as is expedient. And hereto it sufficeth, that what the chiefe ruler can not do in his owne person, he do it by others hauing power and auctoritie vnder him. The Quene pardy ruleth not the whole Realme of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, that is to saye euery part and parcell of it in her owne Maiesties person and by her self, but by others, who haue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoritie vnder her. And yet is she Quene of England, and in all right of a king supreme gouernour of the same. And hard it is not thus to rule, when subiectes liue in obedience. Right so it fareth with the church, which is the one folde whereof by Christes appointment there is one head shepeherd,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioan.</hi> 21.</note> the successour of him, to whom Christ sayd, <hi>Fede my shepe.</hi> Who so euer will not be fedde nor ruled by this one shepeherd, and breaketh out of this one folde: he sheweth him selfe not to be a shepe, but a goat, not of this flocke of Christ, but of the herd of Antichrist.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For all the Apostles, as Cyprian sayeth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apologie <hi>De simpli. praelat.</hi> Confut. Povver double, ordinary, and by priuilege.</note>
                     <hi>vvere of like povver a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselues, and the rest vvere the same that Peter vvas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Power is double, the one ordinary, the other by priuilege or extraordinary. Ordinary power is that which contineweth
<pb facs="tcp:3928:61"/> in one and the same course for euer. According to which po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer Peter was head of the church, and his successours after him. Power by priuilege or extraordinary is that which is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen besides the common course by waye of dispensation. As where the other Apostles should haue receiued ordinare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their power from Peter, as who had commission ouer all, both lambes and shepe, among whom the Apostles had their place: Christ by speciall grace preuenteth ordinary course, and maketh them for the time, and in their persons equall with Peter in the office of Apostleship. Thus concerning or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary power Peter is head of the Apostles, and by that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son they are subiect vnto him, as shepe vnto their shepeherd. But by priuilege true it is, as S. Cyprian sayeth, they were of like power among them selues. Now what oddes there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt an ordinary auctoritie of iudging geuen to any officer for him selfe and his successours in that office for euer, and a speciall commission for life time only: so much is betwixt Peter and the rest of the Apostles.</p>

Yet as touching power and auctoritie of regiment, the patriarkes of Constantinople, Alexandria, and Antiochia be aboue bishops of other dioceses, and the bishop of Rome Peters successour is aboue all. As in the bodye of man we may see diuersitie tempered with vniformitie, in such wise as the body being one,<note place="margin">

This knotte requireth a mutuall consent of the whole bodye, but chiefly the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde of priestes among whom although dignitie be not common to them all, yet order is generall,</hi> as Leo writeth. <hi>For euen among the most blessed Apostles</hi> (sayeth he) <hi>in likenes of honour there was oddes of power,</hi>

                     <hi>and whereas the election of them all was equall, yet to one was it geuen to be ouer the rest. Out of which platte rose the distinction also of bishops, and with great prouidence it hath ben disposed, that all shuld not take all vpon them, but that in euery prouince there shuld be one, who might first geue his sentence among his brethren: and againe that in the great Cities some shuld be ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for taking vpon them matters of greater care, through whom the charge of the vniuersall church shuld haue course to the one see of Peter, and that nothing shuld euer dissent frō the head.</hi> By which wordes we are taught, that God, who is not God of strife, but of peace and loue, hath appointed this order for keping peace and vnitie in the church, that not only the order of priestes
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:3928:62"/> shuld be distinct from the order of the laitie, but that among priestes also them selues and bishops, though order were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, yet dignitie shuld not be a like. For the order of bishops and priestes is one but the dignitie of bishops is greater. And among bishops there is equalitie of honour, but oddes of power. How great and honorable so euer the rome is that any bishop is placed in, be he archbishop, metropolitan, primat, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarke, or Pope him selfe: he is no more a bishop thē any other of those, who occupie the lowest rome.<note place="margin">The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie betvven bishops vvherein it consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth.</note> The diuersitie consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in this, that they are called to part of charge in sundry proportiōs, as their bishoprikes are greater or lesser, the Pope hath committed vnto him the charge of the whole folde of Christ, and hath the fulnes of power. For if all were of like power, as these defenders teach, vnitie could not be mainetei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.

In asmuch as the B. of Rome hath ben wont from the beginning to graunt to the B. of Alexandria iurisdiction ouer Egypte, Libia and Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poli: the Nicene Councell folowing his auctoritie and rule, or at least his vsage, willeth and graūteth that the sayd bishop retaine and kepe his auncient right. For if the B. of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria had not receiued such iurisdictiō by auctority and graūt of the B. of Rome of olde tyme, what reason should haue moued those fathers for confirmation thereof to alleage the

If any other thing be alleaged to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue ben his maner and custome, besides that the wordes of the canon beare it not, what had that ben to the purpose, what so euer it be, for cause and confirmation of the B, of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria his iurisdiction ouer Egypte, Libia and Pentapoli? Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage you Defender for olde custome of the B. of Rome what elles you list, so that you make no violence to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and thereupon make your argument inferring of your allegation the conclusion, (ergo the B. of Alexandria ought to haue iurisdiction ouer Egypte, Libya and Pentapoli): and you shall finde it to be such an argument as any sot would be ashamed to make.</p>
                  <p>Thus it is euident the olde custome of the B. of Rome in graunting to the B. of Aexandria iurisdisdictiō ouer Egypte, Libya, and Pentapoli, to be the cause why the fathers of the Nicene councell by their canon ratified the same, and would admitte no alteration nor chaunge therein. Whereby they shewe them selues to stand to the arbitrement and auctoritie of the B. of Rome in limiting and appointing to bishops the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ire iurisdictions, as the supreme iudge.

<pb facs="tcp:3928:65"/> Right so a bishop is a name of honour, but rather of labour. And though a man seeke to haue preeminence, and not to profite others: yet being once rightly consecrated bishop, no man may vnderstand the contrary, but that he is a bishop, but an euill bishop, and that he standeth answerable to God for that great charge taken vpon him. As for the order, during lyfe it is not taken from him. And in asmuch as he kepeth the same, why shuld he be bereft of the name? For what a man is, the same he is called. What if a iudge geue wrong iudgement? Is he not for all that a iudge? What if a king seduced by euill counsailours rule not his realme so as he ought to do? Is he therefore not a king?

In great Cities where the highest courtes for iustice were kept, and where the chiefe pagane priestes of the Latines na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>primi Flamines</hi> were resident before the comming of Christ, there after Christes cōming were Patriarkes or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates placed, by whom the weighty matters of bishops shuld be decided.

<pb facs="tcp:3928:67"/> Irenaeus termeth them, who there preached, there gouerned, and there suffered their martyrdom, it hath more commonly ben called the Apostolike See, then a primate See. After these, other sees were ordeined by the Apostles successours to be of that dignitie,<note place="margin">Patriark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships or primate Sees.</note> when as nations were conuerted to the faith, ouer whom for their multitude necessitie required Primates to be constituted,<note place="margin">Dist. <hi>99.</hi> c. nulli.</note> as it appereth euidently by a decree of <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetus</hi> the Pope. So Constantinople, so Cantorbury, so Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leia, so Venis, and certaine other Cities were aduaunced to the honour of patriarkships, or which is one of primate Sees. And so there were certaine in Aphrike. For the Citie of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage was a primate See, the prouince of Numidia had a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate See, the prouince of Mauritania had an other, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince of Tripoli an other. In the second canon of this third Councell of Carthage, the fathers making a decree that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry yere a Councell be kept for all Aphrike, appoint, that all the prouinces which haue first or primate Sees, send from their synodes to the councell ech one two bishops. <hi>But from Tripoli</hi> (saye they) <hi>for the small number of bishops there, let but one bishop come.</hi> Now the councell of Carthage by this Defender alleaged and likewise the Aphrican councel ordeined and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that a bishop of any of the primate Sees of Aphrike should not be called <hi>princeps sacerdotum aut summus sacerdos, prince or chiefe of the priestes, or highest priest,</hi> by which word a bishop is there signified: but onely a bishop of the primate See whereof he was primate. By which decree they willed only their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates of Aphrike to kepe them selues within their limites, and not presumptuously to take vpon them more gloriouse titles and further iurisdiction, then to them perteined. lest surely they might seme to preiudicate the Popes supremacie. Thus it is euident thauctoritie of that Carthage councell being restrained to Aphrike onely, that by this canon the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3928:67"/> primacie and title is no whit diminished or disproued. And so for all this Defender, he remaineth as he hath euer, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghest bishop.</p>

Now sithens it can not be proued that euer any bishop of Rome either before of after Gregorie would so be called, neither that in this respect he chalengeth any auctoritie to him selfe that is none of his: what shame is it herein this Defender to belye him in saying that he doth plainely cōtrary to the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient councels, and contrary to the olde fathers. In dede the six hundred and thirty fathers of the general councel of Chal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cedon gaue to Pope Leo that name, as Gregorie in three sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry epistles writeth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Actio.</hi> 3.</note> and certaine other in their writinges haue attributed to the Pope the same. But that either Leo or any other his successour affected so to be called, Gregorie denyeth. And that any since Gregories time to our dayes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer called or wrote him selfe vniuersall bishop, we denie. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:3928:68"/> and in Gregories time that name was chalenged ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously by the bishop of Constantinople, but therein he was resisted and duly rebuked by Pelagius the 2. Gregorie, and Boniface the 3. his successour.</p>
                  <p>Whereas Pelagius and Gregorie writing against the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of Iohn the B. of Constantinople for taking vpon him this name, are much alleaged by the ennemies of vnitie against the auctoritie of Peters successour ouer the whole church: we saye that they folowing the steppes of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours refused the name of vniuersal bishop in such sense as Pelagius and specially Gregorie oftentimes declareth, that where one is called vniuersall bishop, he semeth to be called bishop alone, so as bishoprike should be taken awaye from all others. But they refused not so to be called after this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as though by that refusall the auctoritie of the B. of Rome should be restrained and not extend ouer the whole church. They denie that any man might so be vniuersall bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, as he should be also the peculiar ruler and gouernour of euery particular church. For so all other bishops had ben in vaine, and that is contrary to Christes institution, who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined al the Apostles to be bishops. They refused the proude name, in that sense as it semed to them to importe iniurie to other bishops, not the thing by the name in a right sense signified, which is apostolike auctoritie reaching ouer the whole church. To say all in fewe, they refused the name that might odiously be taken, they refused not the primacie which Christ to them had committed. Therefore Gregorie writing to Morice the Emperour alleaging the wordes that make for Peters auctoritie ouer the whole flocke of Christ, saieth of Peter, <hi>The charge of the whole church and principalitie is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, and yet is he not called vniuersall Apostle.</hi> Where it is plaine that Gregorie doth both affirme the charge of the

                  <p>This then being so, let me haue leaue to oppose one of these Defenders consciences.

How saye you Syr minister Bishop, ought the minister to be laufully called? ought he duely and orderly to be preferred to that office, or (as the Latine here hath) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted or put in auctoritie ouer the church? in the Apologie this defender sayeth yea. Thē answer me directly. How proue you your selfe laufully called to the rome you take vpon you to occupie? First touching the ordinary successiō of bishops, from which as you knowe Irenaeus, Tertullian, Optatus and Augustine bring argument and testimonie of right and true religion: do you allow the same with those fathers or no? If not, then dissent you from the learned and most vncorrupt antiquitie. which is not reasonable, neither then are to be heard. If yea, then how can you recken vs vp your succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, by which you may referre your imposition of handes and consecration to some of the Apostles or of their scolers, as the foresaid fathers dyd to repell the nouelties of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,<note place="margin">Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of doctrine ioyned vvith suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of persons</note> and defend their continuall possession of the church?

How many can you tell vs of, that being your predecessours in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, were of your opinion, and taught the faithfull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that dioces the doctrine that you teach?

So after that we haue reckened all the bishops of Salisburie from bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop Capon vpward, we shall come at length in respect of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and orders to S. Augustine the Apostle of the English, who was made bishop by Gregorie, and from Gregorie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to S. Peter. And in al that rewe of bishops we shall fynde neuer a one that beleueth, as M. Iuell beleueth, ergo your Zuinglian and Caluinian belefe M. Iuell and of the rest of your felowes is not catholike. But what speake we of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession to them, who haue no orderly succession, as no secte of heretikes euer had?</p>
                  <p>Therefore to go from your succession, which ye can not proue, and to come to your vocation, how saye you Syr? you beare your selfe as though you were bishop of Salisbury.<note place="margin">Hard questions propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to M.

The matter brought to iudgement, Athanasius and those bishops both denyed the fact, and also though it were graunted, yet defended the same as well done, because Ischyras was not a laufull minister of the church. And why so? Because he was not laufully made priest, nor with churchly laying on of handes cōsecrated. For proufe thereof they alleaged, that neither he was of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those whom Alexander bishop of Alexandria before Athanasius receiued into the church made priestes by Mele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius the heretike, neither that he was by the sayd Alexander created.

                  <p>Now concerning the ministers of the church, we saye that they open and shut by dispensing the sacramentes, who haue their vertue of the merites of Christ.

The priest which is the minister of absolution according to the auctoritie geuen to him by Christ, in his owne person assoyleth the penitent saying, I assoyle thee in the name of the father &amp;c. The preacher in that he preacheth only, doth not assoyle sinners, neither geueth he the merites of Christ, nor full pardon by pronouncing vnto them the gospell. For if that great benefite consisted in pronouncing or denouncing of the gospell, then why might not euery lay man, yea women, yea yong boyes and gyrles assoyle synners?
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:3928:74"/> yea why might not euery man assoyle him selfe? And would ye Syrs appoint vnto vs such for iudges constituted by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste?

And if absolution consist in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of the gospell, which profiteth so much as it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued, then the power of the keyes which Christ hath geuen to the church, consisteth not so much in the minister, as in the synner that heareth and beleueth, and so is forgeuen by Luthers opinion. And by this meanes the priest hath no spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall power. But we saye with the church that a sacrament hath his efficacie of the institution of Christ in him, to whom it is adhibited. Which efficacie dependeth not of the hearing or vnderstanding of that which is signified. The word which is the forme of a sacrament, is operatorious or
<pb facs="tcp:3928:75"/> working, as S. Ambrose termeth it that is to witte, hath po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to worke the determinat effect, yea without the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of him to whom it is directed. Therefor absolution which pertineth to the sacrameent of penaunce being duely ministred by the priest, the penitent duely receiuing the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, that is, after contrition and confession of his synnes and due satisfaction done or to be done, is acquitted and forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. In this sense the catholike church of Christ hath euer taught, that god worketh our saluation by sacraments, and in this faith it hath alwayes baptized infants, that their synnes being remitted they might be made the children of god. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewise by the keyes of the church it hath assoyled persons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft of the vse of speach and reason, as the learned and aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient holy father Leo teacheth in his epistle ad Theodorum episcopum Foroiuliensem,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Finally if the office of loosing that is absolution consisted in preaching the gospell, and offering the merites of Christ by pronouncing the wordes in which the remission of our synnes is expressed, as this Defender teacheth: then had not the catechumens of old tyme neither now should they be in any danger, if they shuld dye without baptisme and the grace of reconciliation, that is not being assoyled. For they lacked no preaching, as now they lacke not where any such bee.

It is by him no lesse then <hi>exitium,</hi> which is vtter vndoing. And yet these two sortes of men though they lacke their ministers, may easely haue the doctrine of remission of synnes pronounced vnto them out of the gospell. Which preaching and pronouncing of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell notwithstanding, the penitent dying without ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, dyeth no lesse then a Catechumen without baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, as S.

<pb facs="tcp:3928:76"/> them? The cōtrition of harte they seme to speake of sufficeth not for loosing of synnes, onlesse it be contrition formed with charitie, as the diuines teach. Which charitie, seeketh and requireth the sacrament of penaunce and the grace of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, which can not be ministred but by a priest.

                  <p>Touching the second point, wherein after your opinion the office of loosing consisteth, as we acknowledge,<note place="margin">Loosing of them vvhich be excōmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate.</note> that the laufull power to excommunicat offenders is in the bishops who haue iurisdiction ecclesiasticall, or in such as that power is committed vnto by the prelates of the church: so the same haue power and auctoritie to assoil them and to loose them from all band of excommunication, and to reconcile them to the church againe, after that hauing done their penaunce enioyned they haue by some euident tokens declared them selues to be vnfaynedly amended. But we do not attribute the loosing of such as be excommunicate to the offering of Christes merites and pronouncing of the gospell vnto them as you do, but to the power of iurisdiction by Christ geuen to the church. And whereas you saye that <hi>they vvho haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended their brothers myndes vvith a great offence and vvith a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and open fault, thereby haue as it vvere bannished and made them selues straungers from the common fellovvship and from the</hi> body of Christ: you seme to speake more confusely then this
<pb facs="tcp:3928:77"/> matter requireth. We saye according to scripture and doctrine of the catholike church, that all such persons (to speake right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) haue not bannished them selues as it were from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon felowship, as you terme it, so as they may seme to haue departed from the church by their owne accord, for so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly do schismatikes and heretikes: but according to the gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atnes of the crimes committed be excommunicat either by sentence of man or by the lawe, and cutte awaye from the body as rotten members, and according to the power of byn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and loosing geuen to the Apostles and their succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours, be declared to be had and taken as hethens and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, as Christ cōmanded, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18. and consequently be reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the communion of the faithfull, whereof they are called excommunicated, for that they haue no common part with the rest of the children of the church, of the merites of Christ imparted vnto vs in the sacramentes.

                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</note> This doctrine of yours, wherby ye confounde the keyes, powers, and ministeries, doth not only obscure the scriptures, and bring the people to great errours: but also vnder preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of a loue toward preaching of the gospell, leadeth them into contempt of the sacramentes, and specially of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of penaunce, without which if after baptisme we haue synned, (not being letted by case of necessitie wherein will desire and vowe is accepted) we can not atteine to saluation.

For so that wicked maister of yours teacheth. that,<note place="margin">Caluines wicked doctrine against the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> where Christes death may be remembred otherwise, there all the sacramentes be superfluous.

So that by him if a booke, picture, image, a woman, a boye, a girle, or any other thing put a man in mynde of Christes death, the sacramentes be nedeles. And then, because no other thing bringeth to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēbrance the death of Christ more then preaching, to what purpose serue all the sacramentes?</p>
                  <p>Thus these Defenders with their Maister Caluine haue fownde a shorter waye to heauen then was knowen before. Thus they haue set S. Augustine to scoole againe, who in so many places declareth the cathechumens that lacked no put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in mynde of Christes death, as daily being instructed therein, and penitentes, which also might easely minde the passion of Christ, to be in danger of damnation, if they dyed, those without baptisme, these without the grace of recōcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not being kept therefrom by necessitie. For in that case their vowe or desire of these sacramentes might stand thē in stede of acte and dede. But by Caluine they be but helpes to put vs in minde of Christes death, lacking other meanes to bring the same to our remembrance.

                  <p>But to retourne to the keyes, which seme to you to haue no force ne vse but in preaching. First as touching the scornefull scoffes vttered by you Syr Defender in latine, and by your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter in english against priuate cōfessions, and against the ministers of the church appointed by God for grace of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cōciliation to be imparted to penitentes: your light mocking sprite delyteth your selues not so much, as it pittieth vs to see you both so fast bounde in Satans fetters.<note place="margin">of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</note> Next concerning Confession necessarely required to the vse and power of the keyes, which you speake of at your pleasure, thus we saye according to the scriptures. Among sundry effectes for which Christ gaue the keyes to the Apostles and their successours, this is one, that by power of them they should remitte and reteine synnes, as him selfe said, <hi>Whose synnes ye remitte, they are remitted vnto them, and whose sinnes ye reteine, they are reteined.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                  <p>Whether these Defenders allowe publike confession or no, we knowe not, but whereas they inueigh against priuate confessiō, and saye in spiteful wordes, which they haue lerned in the scoole of Satan being loth the synnes of the people whereby he holdeth his kingdome, should be remitted, that Christes disciples receiued not the auctoritie of the keyes, that they should heare priuat confessions of the people, and listen to their whisperinges: we tell them, that confession of all deadly synnes is of the institution of God, not of man. But concerning the manner of confessing secretly to a priest alone,<note place="margin">Priuate Cōfessiō.</note> it is most agreable to naturall reason, that secrete syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes be confessed secretly. But in case any man in reuenge of his synnes, or for humbling him selfe, or for example of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or for edifying of the church which he hath offended, will confesse his secrete sinnes openly: it is not against the commaundement of God, so that alwaies synnes be confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and that to a priest. For proufe of this doctrine of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, besides the foresaid scripture, we haue the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the most auncient and best lerned fathers.<note place="margin">Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the fathers for priua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.

No man speaketh more plainely of secrete confession then Origen, and that in sundry places,<note place="margin">Origen.</note> to which for breuities sake I remitte the reader. In. 2. ca.

For confession is not necessary either only for instruction of the thinges that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine to our saluation, or for that the gospell may thereby be heard, as some of these newe Gospellers haue taught: but for that the merite and vertue of Christes passion may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted vnto vs by the sacrament of penaunce and absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <p>Thus we haue declared, that synnes which exclude vs from the kingdome of God committed after baptisme, though they be secrete and of the harte only, be by Christ reserued to the iudgement of the keyes of the church, and to the power of them to whom he said,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>that albeit by the lawes the second mariages be permitted, yet that matter lieth open to many accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

Now as we do not condemne mariage, neither denie but that maried men in the primitiue church and before the
<pb facs="tcp:3928:88"/> gospell was so generally receiued, as it was at length, were and might be called to the dignitie of bishoprike, when scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetie and lacke of single men worthy of that rome was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de: so we see the impure bigamie of our holy gospellers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned both by Chrysostome and S.

                  <p>But if this Defender presse vs with Chrysostome, we ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer rhat though Chrysostome graunte, that a maryed man maye ascend to the holy seate, yet he sayeth not that a man may descend from that holy seate to the Bride bedde.

But that disorder was alwayes by due correction of bishops punished and redressed. So that what soeuer Bale, Poinet, or any other of that filthy railing rable bring out of Huldrike of Auspurg, Huntingdonensis, Capgraue, Chronica Chronica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, or such other obscure and barbarous stories for witnes of priestes manages, seing the same were by good rulers of

Now Spiridion<note place="margin">Spiridion</note> was a man of passing holines, and in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and vertue surmounted all other men of his time, as one that wrought greate miracles, and was taken for a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete.

                     </note> If this one sainct of so great excellencie being made bishop of a maried man serued God neuer the worse for that he was maried: will ye therefore make a generall doctrine, that bishops and pries<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes shall marye, and that thereby they shall be no whit hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from Gods seruice?

And by restraining them from mariage, the church vseth no ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie, nor if it teach that such ought to forbeare mariage, is that to be accompted the doctrine of deuils, but of the holy ghost,<note place="margin">The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of deuils what it is in this case.</note> whereby men are kept from wilfull damnation. To forbidde mariage wholly, vniuersally, and altogether, that is

                     <hi>Aurelius episcopus dixit, &amp;c.</hi> Aurelius the bishop said. Whereas in the councell before this it was treated of the rule of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencie and chastitie, these three degrees through their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrations be annexed to chastitie by a certaine decree writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, to witte bishops, priestes, and deacons. Whom it is thought good, as it becommeth the holy prelates and priestes of God, and likewise Leuites, or such as attend vppon holy sacramentes, to be continent and chast in euery condicion, to thintent they may simply obteine that they pray to god for, that we kepe and obserue that which the Apostles haue taught, and the antiquitie hath kept. Lo syr Defender here you and all your companions that haue vowed chastitie, and yet can not lyue without their louing yokefelowes, haue right good and auncient wytnes, that the single lyfe of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the holy sacramentes was taught by the Apostles, and kept in vre by the antiquitie. Then how farre go ye from truth, right, and reason, in that ye call it the doctrine of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils?</p>
                  <p>And whereas you saye, that of this single lyfe, great vncle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anes and enormities haue folowed: so we saye that in Paules church at London commonly, and specially since the time it was first buylded, many idle and wicked tales haue ben tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, many othes and blasphemies haue ben vttered, many vniust bargaines haue ben made, many naughty frayes haue ben begonne, and sundry other enormities committed: yet is that church Gods house, appointed to be a place of praier, and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3928:92"/> to serue for holy vses. As we like not your railing against the lawe of chastitie and gods ministers, so we do not defend euil and sinfull lyfe. What if the bishop of Augusta fynd fault whith priestes lyues? (which Augusta, and which bishop there ye meane I knowe not, neither wel can I knowe except I sawe your notebooke) what if the Abbot Panormitane, what if one Faber, and one Latomus,<note place="margin">Though priestes euill life be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playned of by so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, yet priestes mariage by them is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</note> mē of our time (I trow) and that zelous mā which wrote the litle tripartite treatise an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Laterane councell, what so euer he was: what if all these (I saye) moued with a zeale and being desyrous of the clergies reformation, lamentably complaine of their loose lyfe? what then?

<pb facs="tcp:3928:93"/> and that they might be admitted to haue wyues. The truth is. Such as were made priestes being maried men in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue church, by no lawes could they euer be forced to leaue their wyues, and once being made priestes, it was neuer he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of that laufully afterward they maried. Then how could Pius saye as ye report of him?<note place="margin">The say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pe Pius falsefied by the De<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fender, weighed.</note> Verely neither Pius the second euer said so, nor Platina his wordes geue that sense. Platina in the ende of this good Popes lyfe, hauing declared his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy actes, at lenght setteth forth also his notable sayinges. Which he was wonte to vtter in his dialy talke, <hi>in prouerbij modum,</hi> that is to saye, <hi>after the maner of a common sayd sawe,</hi> for with that preface he commendeth them. Wherein he folowed Plutarke, Diogenes Laertius, and other writers of lyues. In Platina ye shall fynde these wordes, for one of that Popes say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges. <hi>Sacerdotibus magna raetione sublatas nuptias, maiori resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuendas videri.</hi> As much to say in english: <hi>that mariage was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from priestes with great reason, and that it semed it were to be restored againe with greater.</hi> This saying reporteth not that wyues were taken awaye from priestes as you report, neither that wyues ought to be restored to priestes agayne. It spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth only of mariage, which as before a man enter into holy orders no vowe being made is laufull: so by orders taken a vowe of chastitie being solemly made, is vtterly vnlaufull. If this saying had made so much for your pretensed mariage as ye would men to beleue, ye would neuer haue falsefyed it by such chaunge of wordes. Whether it be more expedient, such as come to the clergy to be required to leade the single lyfe, and to binde them selues therto by vowes, or to enioye the common lybertie of mariage, that we leaue to the church to discusse and order. By priuate auctoritie any man to breake the common ordinaunce of olde tyme constituted by the church, and yet standing in force, and rashly to breake his
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3928:93"/> vowe it is damnable.</p>
                  <p>If Pius sawe many weightier causes for priestes to haue wyues, then for their single lyfe, as ye pretend he did: why did not he, or you in his stede shewe vs what and how substanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all they be? If they be no better then you and your felowes haue vttered in your sermons and writinges hitherto, they are not worth a pipt nootte. This saying of Pius is well to be weighed and scanned. That priestes generally lyued a cleane lyfe, it is much to be wisshed. Whether that cleanes which is requisite to such high ministerie maye be procured by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing wyues, it is doubted, verely the auncient fathers of the church thought the contrarie. Againe it is much to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sydered, whether it be expedient for the lightnes sake of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, to abrogate so holy an ordinance, and to chaunge so good a custome, or rather by seuere discipline to bring the lewd and disordered to good rule. What so euer shall or may be done the one waye or the other by auctoritie of holy chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, this are we assured of, that what so euer shall become of your lay ministers, such as heretofore haue vowed chastitie, and so haue receiued holy orders: must nedes put awaye their vnlaufull yokefelowes, continewe single, and performe their promise to God, if they looke to escape euerlasting damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which S.

And he that bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in Christ so as ye teach, eateth his body and drinketh his bloud. for by your gospell to eate the body is no thing els, but to beleue in Christ. If this be true, then is your supper super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous. For we may and do beleue without eating of bread and drinking of wine. Then what neded Christ to haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted this sacramēt? What nede haue we of bread and wine in churches, or of the whole ceremonie of the supper? Why driue ye men by compulsion to your communion? For who seeth not that a mans soule is more moued by hearing of a sermon to ascend into heauen, and to beleue in Christ, and to geue him thankes for our redemption wrought in his flesh, then by eating of bread and drinking of wine?</p>

The forme of bread and wine which is sene, is the sacrament, that is to saye a signe of the holy thing. For a sacrament besides the outward shape which it representeth to the senses, causeth an other thing to come into knowledge. The thing of this sacrament is of two sortes, the one in the same conte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">

For both good and euill eate Christes body in the sacrament, as is before declared. If they would confesse plainely the very bodye of Christ borne of the virgin Mary to be in dede in the blessed sacrament of the aulter, there made present (the substance of bread and wine being chaunged into the substance of his body and bloud) by the almighty power of the word of consecration, and the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to be receiued to saluation of the good, to damnation of those that haue not worthely examined and prepared them selues thereto,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> as S.

Neither did euer the olde fathers and bishoppes of Rome in the primitiue church (saye what ye wil Defenders) excommunicate them, much lesse did they repute them for wicked persons and paganes. And not seldom the priest at the masse (which for this respect with vnreasonable noueltie ye terme priuate) when none other were disposed to receiue with him sacramentally but spiritually only, hath receiued alone the holy thinges which he hath offered.</p>

Read the epistle of Anacletus, frō whence this decree is taken, and your selues will confesse the same. That holy father and martyr prescribeth the order
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:3928:105"/> which he would to be kept, when bishoppes or priestes saye masse. Which was, that it be done in places consecrated to God, that a bishop at his masse haue witnesses with him mo then an other priest. In the solēne feastes he requireth seuen, fiue, or three deacons, likewise subdeacons and other mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, all clothed in hallowed vestimentes to attend vppon him, to stand on euery syde of him with a contrite harte and humble spirite looking downeward, keping him from mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious men, geuing consent to his sacrifice.

For in that place Anacletus speaketh neuer a word expressely of the lay people. Therefore ye deceiue the vnlerned reader with alye, bearing him in hand the rather to induce him to mislyking of the holy sacrifice of the masse, that by an olde decree the people were required to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, where it perteineth only to the ministers seruing at the aulter, and that not at all times, but in high and solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne feastes.</p>
                  <p>For the better vnderstanding of this decree, specially whereas Anacletus alleageth the Apostles ordinaunce for the same,<note place="margin">See the 9. canon of thapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</note> the nynth canon of the Apostles is to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. In which they require euery ecclesiasticall person to be partaker of the sacrifice that is offered, or to be excluded frō the communion, onlesse he shewe iust cause for the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The reason whereof in that canon expressed is this. <hi>Lest clerkes abstaining from the communion should be occasion of offence

                  <p>Neither is the saying wherewith this Defender belyeth S. Ambrose all only false and contrary to the catholike faith, but also absurd, vnreasonable, and folish. For if bread and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne remaine still after cōsecration the same they were before, as the Lady interpreteth, how then are they chaunged into an other thing? Of that which is chaunged into an other thing, what reasonable man will saye it remaineth still the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me it was before? Remaining the same presupposeth no chaunge, at lest into an other thing. An accidentarie chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge maye be, the thing remaining the same. But to saye of any thing that it is chaunged into an other thing, and yet remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the same: it is as absurde, as to saye, a man is an ape, a stone is yron. For thinges different in substance can not be said the one of the other.</p>
                  <p>The places of<note place="margin">e</note> Gelasius and<note place="margin">f</note> Theodorite in apparence se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to make more for you, and more thē any other doctours.<note place="margin">The pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasius and Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</note> They be commonly alleaged of Luther, Oecolampadius, Bucer, Caluin, and all other that impugne the faith of the Catholike church, concerning this blessed sacrament, not without insultation, as though they had by them wonne the field. So are they wonte to do, that haue litle good matter for defence of a bad cause. And though these two doctours were all together of this opinion, that after consecration the substance of bread and wine remaineth, what reason is it, they only in so great a matter should preiudicate all other holy and lerned fathers, and which is more, the generall councels and the whole church of Christ? But for answer to both,
<pb facs="tcp:3928:111"/> whereas they vtter the truth, and right doctrine of the church in plaine termes, it is reason we accept the same, and for any sentence sounding to the contrary, that we seeke such construction, as falsehed may geue place to truth, noueltie to antiquitie, strangenes to the receiued opinion. The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith we finde in them both within fewe lines after the wordes of this Defenders obiection, first by Gelasius thus expressed. <hi>Sacramenta corporis &amp; sanguinis domini in diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam transeunt spiritu sancto perficiente substantiam, permanent tamen in suae proprietate naturae, The sacramentes</hi> (sayth he) <hi>of the body and bloud of our Lord passe ouer into diuine substance by the working of the holy ghost.

                  <p>Now that we haue the truth confessed by Gelasius and Theodoritus, your obiection must seme to be of litle force. And in dede the same rightly vnderstanded beareth no sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanciall witnes against the catholike assertion.<note place="margin">The wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des of Ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lasius ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined.</note>

Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go it remaineth saye ye. We graunt the substance or nature of bread and wine remaineth after consecration, so as Gelasius vnderstandeth by the name of substance, which is nothing elles but the very nature (as commonly we speake of nature)
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:3928:111"/> that is to saye, the naturall proprieties of bread and wine,<note place="margin">Nature in Gela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius, and substance in Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorite is taken for naturall proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. <hi>Dialog.</hi> 2.</note> for so he expoundeth him selfe afterward, saying <hi>yet they remaine in the proprietie of their owne nature.

Who is not satisfied herewith, may it please him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this that here foloweth for a fuller aunswer as well concerning this obiection made out of Gelasius and Theodoritus, as for the whole doctrine of transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>When it pleased our Sauiour Christ at his last supper to institute this blessed sacrament,<note place="margin">The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> at which he tooke bread and wine, and turned them into his body and bloud, he would in such wise aduaunce these creatures to a much excellenter condicion, as they should loose no whit of their former ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. For the sonne of man came not to destroye, but to saue, and as S. Augustine sayeth,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>83.</hi> quest.</note> is not cause that any thing tend vnto not being. Now whereas euery creature first hath his substance whereby it consisteth, next his naturall effect ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in the order which God hath appointed it vnto, third<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly his accidentary properties which by our fiue senses we may comprehend: it hath liked Christ to vse for his purpose not the accidentary properties of bread and wine, (where vppon
<pb facs="tcp:3928:112"/> pure men haue some power), but the inward substāce it selfe, which as God only made, so he only can at his pleasure chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge.

                     </gap>ges in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which they are conuerted, againe in their vertue and strenght which their accidentary properties haue in the stede of substances. For as in their substance there was nothing more excellent, then that they were of them selues not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their being in any other thing, so that vertue is kept still in their quantitie and qualities. Which nolesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist by them selues, (and that by miracle), then if they were substances.</p>

And therefore sith the accidentes haue their being by them selues in this sacrament, and be not stayd on any other thing: in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration substance of them may so be reported, as if them selues were substance.

And no maruell if they spake not in most exact wise of this
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:3928:112"/> secrete point of doctrine at what time it was not as yet by the church so clerely and fully discussed. But sithens of the scoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemē it hath ben more distinctly named the existence of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes without their subiect, that is without an other thing whereupon they might staye.</p>
                  <p>Againe whereas bread and wine by their nature do nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, this vertue also remaineth in the accidentes geuen to thē by the almighty word of God, who changeth creatures to their bettering, not to their impairing, This was the meaning of Gelasius, and Theodoritus where they saye, the bread and wine to remaine in their former substance or nature. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise should they be contrary to them selues, as they which also do acknowledge the nature of bread and wine to be changed into a more excellent substance by the workefull word of Christ. Seing then there is a chāge by all cōsent, and most certaine it is that the chāge is not in the accidentes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we see them remaine as they were before, and God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth not our senses in their true and propre obiect, which is colour, tast, smell, &amp;c: it must nedes be,<note place="margin">Change in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</note> that the change be in substance, which is to sense incomprehensible, that when Christ informeth our vnderstanding saying of that which semed bread, <hi>this is my body,</hi> he nolesse telleth vs that the being or essence of these thinges, is only his body and bloud, then he sheweth to our senses that the owtward formes are the formes of bread and wine in all vertue and strenght of substance and nature, which they had before.</p>

Bread, to witte which they sawe and their eyes told them of, is according to the instructiō of faith, the holy body of Christ. To this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction must we stand by S. Augustine him selfe so set forth. Neither hereof can you take any aduantage against vs. And is it any maruell if he spake to such younglinges in the faith of that mysterie, so as he might seme to haue respect of their small vnderstanding? Wherein he leadeth them from

And that you haue in your latine, <hi>quod quidē ad materiā attinet,</hi> which is by your interpreter <hi>as touching the materiall substance thereof,</hi> it is not Origēs, but your owne forged stuffe to deceiue the ignorant with all, to thend they might be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by your false handling of that doctor to beleue the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and substance of very bread to remaine. He speaketh not of the matter of bread, but of that which is materiall in this sacrament, meaning the accidentes or qualities remaining af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter consecration, which be materiall, but not the matter it selfe of bread (as matter is taken for the one part of a perfect substance) and the same accidents be voided forth, as Origen had good cause by occasiō of Christes wordes to declare, you had none to recorde to the same. But it liked your filthy spri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te with vile wordes to bring that holy mysterie and blessed sacrament into contempt. Wherein ye do the deuill authour of all heresies the greatest seruice that may be deuised. Now hauing plainely shewed these Defenders belying of the fathers, let vs see whether they haue so much grace or mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, as to spare our sauiour Christ him selfe.</p>
                  <p>Lastly they alleage Christes wordes to proue that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of wine remaineth in the sacrament of the aulter after
<pb facs="tcp:3928:114"/> consecration,<note place="margin">The place alleaged out of the gospell cōsidered.</note> which being proued should inferre the like reason also of the bread. <hi>Christ</hi> (saye they) <hi>him selfe sayd, not only after the blessing of the cuppe, but after he had ministred the communion, I will drinke nomore of this fruite of the wine.</hi> Hereunto they adde of their owne heads, <hi>It is well knowen that the fruite of the vine is wine, and not bloud,</hi> By this they would signifie, that in the chalice we haue not Christes bloud, as him selfe said, but mere wine, as against Christ they labour to perswade. This gere is so by them handeled, as though Ladies only should come to turne it into english and make much of it, and noman of witte or vnderstanding might haue the discussion of it. They presuppose for an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted ground (which is not vndoubted in dede) that Christ after his holy supper sayd,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.</note> he would not drinke from thence forth of that generation of the vine, for so be his wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des to be interpreted. Againe they presuppose a matter certai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely false, that Christe added neuer a word more at that time, and in that same sentence, which might declare an other sense of his former saying, were it graunted he had spoken those wordes after communion. Vppon those two groundes, the one not knowen to be true, the other well knowen to be false, they build this conclusion, that the substance of wine re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maineth in the Sacrament, and is not conuerted into the bloud of Christ.</p>
                  <p>For better declaration of this point, it is to be vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that these wordes of Christ (wherein he denieth to drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke from thenceforth of that generation of the vine) are not after one sorte alleaged by the Euangelistes. For Mathew (whom Marke foloweth) doth so place them as spoken after consecration.<note place="margin">Lu. ca. <hi>22.</hi>
                     </note> Luke on the other side putteth them before the wordes of consecration. These Defenders without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther debating, flatly take them to be spoken for their most aduantage, making no mencion of the diuerse maner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hersall,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:3928:114"/> which the Euangelistes vsed in that behalfe. But we saye, that those wordes <hi>(I will not drinke from henceforth of this generation of the vine)</hi> either were spoken only before the communion, or only after, or in both times. If they were spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before cōmunion, (which opinion is the more probable it is very clerely proued by them, that wine remaineth not, as it shal hereafter be deduced. If they were spoken ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only after communion, or in both times, then shall it be made euident, that they rather proue with vs, then make any thing against the conuersion of wine into Christes bloud. Now then we thinke rather those wordes to haue ben spoken before the communion, then after, and that for diuers causes. First Luke wrote after the other two Euangelistes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore maye be thought in writing the very same storie, and in vsing the same wordes, rather to haue put them in a more propre place and order, then in a more vnpropre, specially whereas in the beginning of his gospell he professeth vnto Theophilus, that he writeth<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>Seing then the Euangelistes reherse not all thinges alwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes in the very propre tyme and place they were said and done in, (as it may appere for example in the description of Iohn baptistes death),<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matt.</hi> 14. <hi>Marc.</hi> 6. <hi>Luc.</hi> 9.</note> and seing as euery of them wrote la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, his order is iudged more naturall and proper (for which cause we deduce the whole storie of Christes preaching out of S. Iohn): for these causes it may well be said, that we should rather folowe the order of Luke,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cap.</hi> 22.</note> who witnesseth that Christ spake these wordes before his maundie, then Mathew and Marke, who tell it as spokē after. Secondly the order of Luke is confirmed by the circumstance of the thinges that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth more then the other Euangelistes. For the other
<pb facs="tcp:3928:115"/> speake but of one chalice, but Luke mencioneth two, the one belonging to the ceremonie of the olde lawe in eating the Pascall Lambe (as Hierome, Bede and Theophilact haue ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly declared), the other belonging to Christes holy sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Now because in the chalice of the olde lawe there was certainly not bloud but wine, (whereas Christ teacheth that in his chalice his owne bloud is conteined) let the discrete reader iudge, whether we must not rather thinke that these wordes of Christ, <hi>I will not frō henceforth drinke of this genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the vine,</hi> do not rather perteine to the cuppe of the old lawe, (as Luke placeth thē) then to the chalice of Christ af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the consecration, whereof Mathew and Marke reherse thē. Thirdly Luke reporteth the like wordes to be spoken by Christ, when after the eating of the Pascall Lābe he said, <hi>I saie vnto you from henceforth I will not eate of that, vntill it be sulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the kingdom of God.</hi> And as he reciteth that same to be said of the Lābe, so forthwith he speaheth of a cuppe belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the custome of drinking at the supper of that lambe, likewise adding, that he would not from thenceforth drinke of that generation of the vine. And who seeth not how plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne it is, that Luke hath the very order of the storie, as the thing it selfe was done?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and lastly when Matthew and Marke reherse that Christ said, he would not from thence forth drinke of that generation of the vine, they both in much like sorte of speaking adde thereunto these wordes, (which in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie were guilefully left out) <hi>Vntill that daye when I will drinke it newe with you in the kingdom of God my father.</hi>

And therefore the wordes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto appertening do meane and describe a cuppe of the olde lawe, and not the cuppe of Christ, the which him selfe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:3928:115"/> the newe testament and bloud of the newe testament.</p>
                  <p>Now if that be so, when he sayeth after the drinking of a plaine cuppe of wine, I will not from hence forth drinke of this generation of the vine, vntill the kingdome of God co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, or vntill I drinke it newe in the kingdome of my father, and yet fourth with drinketh of a newe cuppe, which was his owne bloud: doth it not necessarely folowe (whereunto they can neuer answer) that the newe cuppe is not that generation of the vine, that the other was which he pointed vnto, but as he named it, is newe, that is to saye, not olde wine, as it was vnder Moises, but his blessed bloud, as he made it by his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty working at his last supper, in which he turned the wine into his bloud? What exclamation would be sufficient to expresse, that in this weighty point of saluation our english clergie are content to blinde the people, the right worshipful, yea the honourable of our countrie in so vile a sorte, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many fathers wordes misreported, and wrongfully wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, they doubt not to attempt the same in Christes owne sayinges, and in those sayinges of his, which euidently proue the contrarie?</p>
                  <p>But now let vs graunt of our free liberalitie contrary to so many good and strong reasons, that Christ said after consecratiō. <hi>I will not from henceforth drinke of this generatiō of the vine, vntill the kingdome of God come.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:3928:116"/> them of either of both kingdomes, that is to saye, of the kingdom of resurrection, or of glorie, as Chrysostome and other do witnesse, because both were to come at that ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. But if we take them spoken after consecration, as we ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vppon confidence of the truth, then for necessitie at this time do graunt: then these wordes <hi>(Vntill the kingdome of God come)</hi> are to be meant only of the kingdome of glorie. For these holy mysteries belong to the kingdome of Christes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection and ascension. Neither were they practized by the Apostles in the church of Christ, vntill the holy ghost came downe vpon them. Christ then after the institution of the mysteries of the newe testament, speaking of a kingdome to come, doth signifie the kingdome of glorie, and not only the kingdome of his resurrection in this world, and then he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeth, I will not drinke of this generation of the vine (he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth together with you) vntill I drinke it newe with you in the kingdome of my father. And so the newnes of it there is fruition of it not vnder the formes of bread and wine, as we haue it nowe, but face to face without all figure and forme. Then it is to be noted that Christ sayd not, I will drinke no more of the fruite of the vine, But, <hi>I will not from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth drinke of this generation of the vine:</hi> of this I saye, whereof now I haue dronken, which is vnder the forme of wine my bloud, which am the true vine. For whereas this Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie sayeth <hi>(it is well knowen that the fruit of the vine is wine, and not bloud)</hi> it semeth to declare, that the authors thereof are ignorant in the holy scriptures, where they might haue foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de the fruit of some vine to be called bloud. For Iacob sayd to his sonne Iudas bearing the figure of Christ, <hi>He shall wash his robe in wine,</hi>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:3928:116"/> The holy ghost did in these wordes of Iacob prophecie, that Christ the true vine should geue the grape of his body to be pressed vppon the crosse, from whence the wine was shedde, which is in our chalice, as Chrysostom also noteth.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>In.</hi> 1. <hi>Co.</hi> 10</note> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is there vnder an other forme, Christ sayeth, he will not from thenceforth drinke with his disciples of that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the vine, vntill he drinke it newe, that is to saye, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed to immortalitie by resurrection, and shewed in his owne forme and glorie. Hereof Gregorie Nazianzē may be vewed, oratione .4. in sanctum pascha. But specially S.

And now is it no wonder if we expound the word (vine) mystically. For if ye place the saying of it after mysteries, and marke that it is referred to them by a demonstration, to witte, (this generation of the vine) and referred againe to a time in heauen where no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall wine shall be: there is no euasion, but by this genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the vine must be meant that bloud, which was made before in the holy mysteries, and that bloud, which shalbe droncken newe in the kingdome of heauen. For the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all wine is not dronken in heauen, neither was it dronken in the mysteries, and therefore not spoken of in that saying, which so is put betwen the mysteries and the glorie of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, that it referreth it selfe to ech of them. O what strength truth hath, how plainely she dareth to shewe her face, nor nipping the scriptures, nor misenglishing them, nor dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing any iote, that may seme to make against her!</p>
                  <p>

And we say not this is done slighty and couldely, but effectually and truely. For although we do not touche the body of Christ with teethe and mouth, yet wee hold him fast and eate him by faith, by vnderstanding, and by the spirit. And this is no vaine faith whiche doth comprehend Christ: and that is not receiued with colde deuotion, whiche is receiued with vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, with faith, and with spirit.

If then he geue him selfe verely present, as ye saye, he is present in his owne person, god and mā, with body, with bloud, with soule, with Godhed. If ye meane the very presence of his Godhed, that presence belongeth no more to Christ, then to the father and to the holy ghost. And so haue ye not declared any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar presence belonging to his supper. For by presence of his Godhed he is alwayes verely present, as well before supper, as at or after supper, because he filleth heauē and earth. It remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that either ye vnderstand not your selues, or wilfully deceyue that infinite number of soules, for whose sake Christ hath shed his bloud.</p>

                  <p>As here before ye haue said much and proued litle against the reall presence, wresting and stretching certaine fathers sentences and the scripture it selfe to that purpose, not wholy and faithfully, but by piecemeale and patchedly alleaged, so as ye might best make them serue to the maintenance of your false doctrine: right so in the conclusion of that part of your Apologie, with a like grace ye heap a number of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled auctorities together, whereby to perswade, that foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the fathers haue aduertised vs to lifte vp our mindes to heauenward, we should not thinke we eate the flesh of Christ as being here present with vs vnder the forme of bread. Therefore whereas ye laye to the catholikes charge, as though by their sacriledge the people were bereft of a great benefite in that they be taught to be content with the one kinde, vnder the same receiuing nolesse then if they had both: how much more worthely are ye to be charged with the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of sacriledge, that robbe them of the greatest treasure that is in the church, so much as in you lyeth, the body and bloud of our Lord, and in stede thereof pretend to deliuer vnto them a piece of bakers bread and a cuppe of wine?

And because the nature of Godhed can not be eatē, thereof he tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vainely and prophanely, that in the sacrament we eate flesh, and not Godhed. For confutation of this detestable he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, Cyrill bringeth him to the consideration of the blessed sacramēt, and opposeth him whether he thought, that in the sacramēt Christ being (by his doctrine) man besides God the Word, we eate a man, as one would saye, after such sorte, as the barbarous people of the newe foūd land America called Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibales, eate one an other. But because that were absurd and beastly, Cyrill sayeth that we eate not a cōmon body, though

Then visible and weitghty, now in uisible and of no weight? That was done in pompe to the honour of Christ, and so is this. Ye saye this is done after a newe guise. So then was that. The Pope (saye ye) hath no scripture no fathers, no example of antiquitie for thus doing.

Of those paines or of that fyre, or rather of that qualitie and effect of the fyre after this life, he doubted. As for example. There is some one who loueth Christ aboue all thinges, but therewith also he loueth wife, children, house, landes and goods, and that aboue the measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re which he ought to kepe. For such a man in this present time, it is easely perceiued, how the fyre of tribulation may burne and trouble and withall heale and amend his soule, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the sicknes of wife and children, or losse of his tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall goods, wilbe such a griefe vnto him, that the smart the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof maye teach him for euer after, to loue more soberly and moderatly those worldly giftes and commodities. But now whether the smart and sorow of thinges lefte behinde, which proceded in this life of carnall affection, remaine also to the soules after their departure from the body, whereof S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine sheweth him selfe to stand in doubt in Enchiridio ad Lauren. cap. 68. &amp; 69. and whether the fyre which soules feele in Purgatorie as it paineth them, so also do by degrees dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish and correct those veniall and secular affections, which they caried with thē at their death, or whether death it self do

Why then, let the labourers prouerbe take place, I had rather play for nothing then worke for nothing. Is there any labourer so mad, as to worke for nothing? First ye tell the labourers, that there is no helpe for them in theire workes, and then ye crie vnto them to labour, yea forsooth as hard as they list. Is not this to mocke God and the world? If ye spake to painymes and Iewes, to those that were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the faith of Christ, we would saye with you, that they had no helpe to saluation in their workes, because they had not the true foundation of faith, wherevpon workes must be buylded.<note place="margin">

What other thing is this then to geue as it were a watch word to all persons, that they worke no goodnes at all? Nay but we teach (saye ye) that true faith is liuely, and can not be idle. If this be true, there is no true faith amongest you, where are so fewe good workes, so much false doctrine, so dissolute a life. True faith (say ye) can not be idle, but your faith is idle, as rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying all the good workes done in olde time, then making any newe of your owne: therefore say we your faith is not true. And this much to your persons.</p>
                  <p>But now let vs trye whether this proposition be true,<note place="margin">The exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of this proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, true faith is liuely.</note> wherein ye saye true faith is liuely. We fynde these wordes (true faith) to be ambiguous, and that they may be takē two wayes. For as a man may be true of nature, hauing a true bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and a true reasonable soule, and basides that may also be true in keping his promise: euen so faith may be true in his owne nature, (which is to beleue all thinges that God hath reueled) and it may be farther true in keping promise, that is to saye, in performyng that in dede, which was promysed at the font in word, where euery Christen man promyseth to renounce the deuill, the world, the flesh. And contrarywise faith may be true one waye, and not true the other waye. as a man may haue a true body and soule, and yet neither a true harte to God, neither a true performance of his word to his neighbour. For many theues and vsurers beleue all that God hath commaunded them to beleue, and knowe that they do naught, and yet will they not leaue their euill doinges. The which kinde of Christen men haue true faith in bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, but not true faith in performing their obedience which they promised in dede. That faith which beleueth and
<pb facs="tcp:3928:139"/> doth not performe, is dead in comparison of bringing vs to heauen, and yet is it a true faith in the nature of faith. For faith is called liuely of an other vertue, which is without his owne proper nature, and that vertue is charitie. <hi>For neither circumcision</hi> (sayeth the Apostle) <hi>neither vncircumcision is any thinge worth but faith which worketh by charitie.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Galat.</hi> 5.</note> Lo if S. Paul require a faith that worketh by charitie, he doth vs thereby to vnderstand, that faith also may be without working by charitie, according to that the Apostle sayeth in another pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</note>
                     <hi>that faith, hope, and charitie are three.</hi> And yet more plainely he sayeth. <hi>If I haue all faith so as I may remoue mountaines, and haue not charitie, I am nothing.</hi> Where, by all faith, he meaneth al that is faith in the proper nature of faith. For if I haue cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie with my faith, I haue more thē faith, and then my faith is liuely.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iacob.</hi> 2.</note> But faith without charitie, as S. Iames sayeth, is like a body without the spirite. Now as a dead body doth ceasse to be that it was, (for example, a beast, or a man) but it ceasseth not to be a body, euen so faith without charitie ceasseth to iustifie, to worke helthfully, to be liuely, but it ceasseth not to be true faith in that nature which peculiarly belongeth to faith. For as a christen man differeth from a man, so doth li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely faith differre from faith. And as he that is no christen man, maye be a true man: so he that hath no liuely faith, may haue a true faith.</p>
                  <p>Thus ye see that not euery true faith is a liuely faith, and yet so ye would meane, as though it could in no sense be a true faith which is not a liuely faith. And yet to shew it more plainely, as he may be called a dead man in comparison of life to come, who is not Christened, but remaineth a hethen or a Iewe: so that faith is dead, which worketh not by chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. But as the hethen or Iewe is a true man in his nature: so that faith which in respect of saluation is called dead, is a true
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:3928:139"/> faith in the nature of faith. Ergo then although a liuely faith can not be idle, and some true faith is liuely, yet in an other sense, there is a true faith which is not liuely, but idle. Which true faith shall become lyuely and haue great ayde in workes, if it will lerne to leaue idlenes, and practise that in will and harte, which it beleueth in vnderstanding.</p>

There be not yet many yeres past, that ye boasted of your poore small flocke, alluding to the fewnes of the flocke that lyued with Christ in flesh, and made their fewnes an argument of the syncere truth, but now that through your euill teaching, the world groweth more to be dissolute and wicked, ye boast of your number.

These although they be founde written in the scripture, forasmuch as they haue ben commaunded by an occasion and for some cause, they maye for cause and occasion, and as we finde in c. lector, for necessitie, by Gods depute and vicare be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, holpen, expounded. And if the case so require, he in the same for a certaine cause, with a certaine persone, for a certaine time, with certaine circumstances maye despense, by the same spirite they were first founded and instituted withall, and with the same intention, to witte, for some speciall good, and furtherance of godlines. And in this case dispensation made by laufull auctoritie is not to be grudged at, nor to be taken as iniurious to the lawe of God, sith that the lawe and the dispensation tend to one ende, and the lawe it self, if it could speake, in that case would saye, touching the thing to be dispensed, that prohibition should not haue place. The same because the lawe and dead letter can not vtter, the laufull magistrate being minister of the lawe, supplieth, as the liuely voice of the lawe. But the thinges that be good of their owne nature, so be they alwaies good, as occasion or cause can neuer come, where it be right they haue not place. Such administration of Gods lawe, and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:3928:143"/> such dispensation thereof, as of a precious treasure, not free or at libertie and pleasure, but an euen, iust, and good dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they do attribute to Gods vicare, whom this Defender calleth the Popes parasites, pages, and clawbackes, him sefe a very page, slaue, and clawbacke to the Deuill.</p>

                     <hi>of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, of the deuout fathers, and do sincerely with good faith teach the people of God the same. Which thing is the only cause why we at this day are called heretikes of the chief prelate (no doubt) of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. O immortal God hath Christ him self then, the Apostles and so many fathers, all at once gone a straye? Were then Origene, Ambro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, Augustine, Chrysostom, Gelasius, Theodorit forsakers of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith? Was so notable a consent of so many auncient bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes and lerned mē no thing elles, but a conspiracy of heretikes? Or is that now condemned in vs, which was then commended in them? Or is the thinge now by alteration only of mēs affection sodenly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come schismatique, which in them was compted, catholique? Or shall that which in times past was true, now by and by, because it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not these mē, be iudged false? Let thē then bring fourth an other gospel, and let them shew the causes why these thinges which so long haue openly ben obserued, and well allowed in the church of God, ought now in the ende be called againe. We know well ynough, that the same woord which was opened by Christ, and spred abrode by the Apostles is sufficient, both our saluation and all truth to vphold and maintaine, and also to confound all maner of heresie. By that worde only do we condemne all sortes of the old heretikes, whom these men saie we haue called out of hell again. As for the Arians, Eutichians, the Marcionites, the Ebionites, the Valentinians, the Carpocratians, the Tatians, the Nouatians, and shortely all them which haue a wicked opinion either of God the Father or of Christ, or of the holy ghoste, or of any other point of Christian religion, for so much as they be confuted by the gospell of Christ, we plainely pronounce them for detestable and castaway personnes, and defie them euen vnto the deuill. Neither do we leaue them so, but we also seuerely and straightely hold them in by laufull and politike pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishements, if they fortune to breake owt anywhere and bewray them selues.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:3928:144"/> Caluine, Peter Martyr, Bucer and such other Apostates, and that ye do most falsely and wickedly lead the people in to the pitte with you. And therfor ye are iustly condemned by the church and demed heretikes. O mercifull Christ how great is thy patience and longanimitie, that suffrest not only thine Apostles and the holy fathers thy dere frendes, but also thine owne selfe, who art the very truth it selfe, to be so wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by these rebellious sonnes, and alleaged by them for vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houlding and maintenaunce of their lyes and plasphemies? What impudencie is it to call Origen, Ambrose, Augustine, Chrysostom, Gelasius, Theodorite, to witnes against the truth, specially in those places, where they geue irrefragable testimonie of truth? Lord how would they triumphe if (which is not possible) they found the hundred part against the matters we defend, in respect of that we finde for defence of the truth? And could this maruelous and from God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding consent of such lerned and holy fathers be so man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled by false gloses, and expositions, nippinges and cuttinges of their sentences, by other then heretikes, mockers of their mother, despisers of God? But who will heare these falsaries, and not cleaue rather to the sense of the holy ghost in these holy fathers writinges vttered? How can that now seme to serue heretikes, whereby they confuted and vanquished heresies? And yet they be not ashamed so to turne and tosse their workes, as they would make the people wene, they sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de by them, and we were throwen downe by them. Seeing then this is so, let them not go about to set vp a newe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but submit their neckes vnder the gospell of Christ preached by the Apostles, confirmed by miracles, increaced by the bloud and holy lyfe of so many martyrs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours, by holy doctours and obedience of christen people continewed to our times.

But the worlde seeth now right well, thankes be giuen to our God, that wee neyther haue bredd nor taught, nor kept vp these monstres. In good fellowship I pray the whosoeuer thou be, read our bokes, they are to be sould in euery place: What hath there euer ben written by any of our company, which might plainely beare with the madnes of any of those heretiques? Nay I say vnto you, there is no countrie at this daye so free from their pestilent infections, as they be wherein the gospel is freely and commonly taught. So that yf they wey the very matter with earnest and vpright aduisemēt, this thing is a great argument, that this same is the very truth of the Gospell whiche we do teache. For lightly neither is cockell wont to growe without the wheat, nor yet the chaffe without the corne. For from the very
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:3928:145"/> Apostles times, who knoweth not how many heresies did rise vp euen togeather, so soone as the Gospell was first spred abrode? Who euer had heard tel of Simon, Menander, Saturninus, Basilides, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates, Cherinthus, Ebion, Valentinus, Secundus, Marcosius, Colorbasius, Heracleo, Lucianus, and Seuerus, before the Apostles were sent abrode? But whye stande wee reckening vp these? Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius rehearseth vp foure score sundrie heresies, and Augustine many moe, whiche did spring vp euen togeather with the Gospell. VVhat then? Was the Gospell therfore not the Gospell, bycause heresies sprang vp withall? Or was Christ therefore not Christ? And yet as we said, doth not this great crop and heape of heresies grow vp amongest vs, which do openly a broade and frankely teache the Gospell? These poysones take their begininges, their encreasin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and strenght emongest our aduersaries, in blindenes and in darkenes, emongest whom trueth is with tyrannie and cruelty kept vnder, and cannot be hearde but in corners and secrete mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges. But let them make a proofe, let them giue the Gospell free passage, let the truth of Iesu Christe giue his cleare light and stretche forth his bright beames into all partes, and then shall they furthwith see howe all these shadowes streight will vanishe and passe away at the light of the Gospel, euen as the thick myste of the night consumith at the sight of the sunne. For whilest these men sit still and make mery, and doe nothing, we continually represse and put backe all those heresies, whiche they falselye charge vs to nory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>she and mainteyne.</hi>

As though they were not men to whom so ye speake, and might not cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre places in a wrong sense, and both be deceiued and decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue others.

So that when ye saye these sectes spring not vp with you, but rather amongest your aduersaries: by like ye recken the Germaines for your aduersaries. For vndoubtedly there they swarme not now springing vp, but of long time growē, there they haue had to outward shewe semely blossomes, but haue brought forth many a foule fruite. And thinke ye not that our countrie of England shall long be free. It is but young dayes as yet.

                     </note>Some saye the body of Christ in the cōmunion is<note place="margin">i</note> torne and crusshed with teeth, some denye it. Yea forsoth, and both meane right well. The hundred and thirten bishops assembled in Councell at Rome vnder Pope Nicolaus the second, prescribed such forme of recantation to Berenga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius the first auctor of the sacramentarie heresie, openly there to pronoūce, acknowledge, and with subscription to ratifie, as he should confesse the very true body of Christ, not only the sacrament thereof, sensibly and in veritie to be handled with the handes of the priests, to be brokē and crusshed with teeth of the faithfull. By which wordes these fathers mynde was to expresse a veritie of reall presence, a true eating of Christes body in dede, and to exclude the only spirituall eating so as the old fathers did eate Christ in their manna. Neither is this doctrine dissonant from the fathers, specially from Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom, who hath the like wordes Homilia. 45. in Ioannem. Where he saith, that Christ for the great loue he beareth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vs, permitteth him selfe not only to be sene of those that be desirours of him, but also <hi>tangi, &amp; manducari, &amp; dentes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni suae infigi, to be touched, and to be eaten, and teeth to be fastened on his flesh, and that all they be filled with their desire of him.</hi> This doctrine of that Romaine Councell, of Chrysostom, and of the whole church is so to be vnderstanded, that Christ in this blessed sacrament proponeth vnto vs his body not only figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiuely or tropically, but so as we see and beholde the very selfe same euen sensibly, yet not in his owne shape, but vnder the forme and shape of bread, in which it is conteined. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so as we do only beholde it, but also touch it really and crussh it with our teeth, to witte, because vnder the owtward formes, which are touched, brokē, and with the mouth recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, we take the very body of Christ, yet in it selfe vndistract and whole, and inconsumptible. Now where some haue sayd
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:3928:160"/> that Christes body is not so torne and crusshed with teeth, they meane it of the true substance of his body, as it is consy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in it selfe without respect had of thoutward formes of bread and wine, vnder which it is. So that betwen these there is no diuersitie of opinion at all.</p>
                  <p>Likewise they that write, that the body of Christ, which is in the sacrament, is<note place="margin">k</note>
                     <hi>quantum,</hi> that is, hath quantitie: they write truly,<note place="margin">How the body of Christ is in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. quantum, and how not quā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</note> for so hath the substance of his body which is in the sacramēt of thaulter. They which denye this, denye it also truly in their sense, because though that body being a true body, hath quantitie, (otherwise it were not a natural body) yet as it is in the sacrament, so the quantitie dimensiue of it is there after his proper manner, so as there be the whole in the whole, and ech part in ech part: but by manner and meane of the substāce, whose nature is to be whole in whole, and whole in euery part. To speake plainly to the lerned, the lerned scole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men saye, that Christes body though it be <hi>quantum</hi> in it selfe,<note place="margin">Vile. Tho. in. <hi>3.</hi> p. q. <hi>76.</hi>
                     </note> yet it is not in the sacrament <hi>per modum quanti.</hi> Or rather that the substance of Christes body is in the sacrament <hi>ex visacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti,</hi> after which manner his quantitie dimensiue is not there. But because the substance of that bodye is not really diuided from his quantitie dimensiue, and from his other accidentes: therefore <hi>ex vi realis concomitantiae,</hi> such quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of that body, is in this sacrament, as all other his acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</p>
                  <p>Because both these and also your fewe other obiections which ye make against the vnitie of the catholike church, be such as no wise man will make any accompt of, and I feare me the reader is wearied with this much already, and faine would I bestowe the time better: how so euer our sauiour Christ<note place="margin">l</note> cōsecrated, with a certaine diuine power, or with his almighty blessing, or with vtterāce of wordes,<note place="margin">Consecratiō</note> or with repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OW come the reuerent fathers of our newe clergie of England to one of the chiefest pointes,<note place="margin">Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to treate of in their Apologie, which is the charging of the Catholike Christians, as well the laie as the clerkes, with greate and heinous crimes. But as hereby their owne crimes be not discharged, and we presume not to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge vnto vs the estimation of innocencie: so we are right well content to heare of our faultes, that truly, though neuer so bitterly may be obiected. Wherin if we vse the buckler of truth, to breake the blowes of lying, being laufull by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we of nature euery one to defend him selfe: we trust to seme to do no otherwise, then becommeth.<note place="margin">It is not reason the church of this age be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with the defaultes of all ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes past.</note> And albeit we answer for others of sundry times past, yet we doubt not, but the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of wise men is such, as it shall not be thought reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the catholike church of this age be burthened with what so euer hath by any fortune, or person, ben done amisse in all ages past. How so euer it be, though faultes be founde in vs, as no maruell, we being men: we require our whole cause to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me no further to be iustified or fauoured, then truth shalbe founde in these Defenders syde.</p>
                  <p>First who seeth not what a notorius lye they make in the preface and entrie to the matter? Saye they not,<note place="margin">The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders saye they will not do that, which chiefly and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they do. And saye, they saye not that, which of purpose they saye.</note> they take not vpon them at this time to bring to light and to the she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we of the world those doinges, which ought rather together with the auctours of them to be buried? And that so to do, their religion, their shamefastnes, their blusshing doth not beare it? What is a lie, if this be not? Do they not in dede, that they denye in word? Yea, saye they not that thing, which they affirme they saye not? How may a true man deale with these felowes? And good Sirs, if the thinges ye tell be such, as ought rather to be buried together with the autours of
<pb facs="tcp:3928:168"/> them, why tell ye them? Why contrary to your owne word and conscience bring ye them to light and to the shewe of the worlde?<note place="margin">Beholde the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnes, the blus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders.</note> O saye ye, our religion, our shamefastnes, our blusshing doth not beare it. But sith ye do it, and yet saye ye do it not, what truth haue ye? What religion? What shamefast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes? What blushing? I can not compare you better then to a theefe, who meeting an honest man by the high waie, geueth him a great woonde in the head, bindeth him hande and foote, tombleth him into a dyche, taketh all that he hath from him, and then telleth him: Syr, I meddle not with you, I touch you not, my cōscience serueth me not to take ought from you. What figure of Rhetorike call ye this? What figure so euer ye also here pretended to vse, be it <hi>pseudologia,</hi> be it <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisis,</hi> or what els soeuer it be, the same is very grosse. Make of it what ye can, a lye is a lye.</p>
                  <p>But let vs come to the very point, and see, what haynous matters they lay to the catholikes charge, and first to the Popes. They be the Popes<note place="margin">a</note> Canonistes (saye they) that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue taught the people,<note place="margin">Crimes layd to the Popes charge by the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note> that simple fornication is no synne. A greuous offence and worthy to be punished. And verely if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Pope euer knewe that his lerned men in the Canon lawe haue taught the people such hethenish and deuillish doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, though no man in earth be his iudge, yet he may be thought vnworthy the rome of so great charge. But if the Pope neuer knewe such doctrine preached by the Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes, and if at no time there haue ben any such: then is he clear, and ye are proued slaunderers and false backebyters. We denye it vtterly, how proue ye it? Mary Sir saye ye, looke in the margent of our Apologie, and there shall ye finde one Iohn de Magistris noted for an offender in that behalfe. Wel, if it were so, he was but one man. Ye speake of Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes, which word signifieth a number. And how proue
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:3928:168"/> ye that he the said Iohn de Magistris (for now I will spare you and will not saye they) taught the people that simple fornication was no sinne? The note of your booke is, <hi>de temperantia.</hi> What meane ye by that? Made he a booke <hi>de temperantia,</hi> and commendeth he that singular vertue with defence of so great vncleanes? It can not seme likely. The matter being so hainous, and so contrary to scripture, and profession of christianitie, it had ben your secretaries part to haue named the booke, the place, and the chapter, for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of his credit. But this is not the first lie he hath made in write, talke, and preaching. Haue an eye to him syrs, when he shall haue the penning of any matter of yours. For if ye haue not, ye may happen to heare of molies, then glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ye would be charged with.</p>
                  <p>Now we tell you,<note place="margin">Ioannes de Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Defen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ders for Martinus de Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris.</note> that we can not finde where euer Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes de Magistris wrote so impiously, as ye report. Is it not Martinus de Magistris, that ye meane? It is a great rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, if ye haue not read it your selues, to beleue such pelting writers that be of your sectes, as ye do, by whom ye seme to be most shamefully and most dangerously deceiued. Well, perhappes ye saye, it is a small matter to misse the right name of a man. In a light matter, it were an ouer sight. But in so weighty a case as this is, the crime imputed being so hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, if ye charge one man therewith for an other: I can not see, what I may call it, nor how I may excuse it. But let vs wincke at you for this, and leauing the name, let vs speake of thinges. What will be thought and said of you, if we shewe plainely, that ye haue forged a fowle lie, and a most false sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>under vpon Martinus de Magistris? For so will we call him, vntill ye proue it of Iohannes?</p>
                  <p>This Martinus de Magistris was no Canonist, as ye saye,<note place="margin">A fowle slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous lye made by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders.</note> but a doctor of diuinitie, well lerned for his time and order
<pb facs="tcp:3928:169"/> of studie, as a scooleman. In a treatise that he made <hi>De tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perantia &amp; de luxuria,</hi> he disputeth after such maner as the scolasticall doctours commonly vse. Wherefore he that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeth that he taught the people, fought by vntruth how to make the matter more detestable. For disputing in scooles, and teaching the people, be farre asunder. Saith this doctor Martin after the guise of scooles, <hi>Quaeritur vtrum simplex fornicatio sit peccatū mortale,</hi> that is to saye, <hi>it is a question, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther simple fornication be mortall sinne.</hi> This defender knewe what he did, when he left out the word mortall.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours.</note> he thought best, to lye for a vantage. Now this is to be vnderstanded, how the maner of the scolasticall doctours is, first to propound a question. Next to argue, obiect, and reason against the truth of the question. Then to auouch and proue the truth. After that to soile the obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons brought against the truth. Lastly to bring conclusions for confirmation of the truth. Then in prosecuting his question, <hi>arguitur quod non, I reason against it,</hi> saith he, and argue it is not so. And there after the scoole maner he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth an argument against the truth. Which argument who so euer taketh for his purpose and alloweth it, admitteth that the doctor goeth against and disproueth.<note place="margin">Martinus de Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the crime by the Defen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ders ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected.</note> After this he commeth to proue the truth. And there it foloweth. <hi>In oppositum, simplex fornicatio excludit &amp;c. To the contrary</hi> (saith he). <hi>Simple fornication excludeth frō the kingdome of God, ergo it is mortall sinne.</hi> Then he saith further. <hi>It is to be noted that the opinion of Thomas is, that simple fornication vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly is mortall sinne.</hi> Who so euer readeth further in Martinus, he shall finde after he hath well disputed <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> as they terme it in scooles, that is to saye for, and against the truth, that he putteth six cōclusions, of which the fourth beginneth thus, <hi>ideo &amp;c. Therefore simple fornication is mortall
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:3928:169"/> sinne, because it is forbidden by gods lawe, &amp;c.</hi> And in the ende of the sixth, he saith. <hi>Hereof the falsehed of their opinion is made euident, who saye that simple fornicatiō is not mortall sinne. Which opinion is condēned in the articles of thē of Paris, errore.</hi> CLXXXVj. Then he saith further. <hi>Guido the Carmelite saith in a chapter con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tra errores Graecorum, that the errour of the Grekes, saying simple fornication betwen a single man and a single woman not to be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall sinne, openly conteineth heresie against the holy scripture, and that he proueth by foure reasons. &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this and much more there expressed, it is sufficiently proued, that Martinus de Magistris in his scolasticall dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in the said treatise, saith not that simple fornication is no sinne, much lesse can it be reasonably, or with any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of honestie said, that so he taught the people. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is falsely and slaunderously imputed vnto him.</p>

                        <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.</note> Let him remember what S.

                     </note> But to vnderstand what was done to a priest that had committed fornication, by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of lawe, in case any bishop, or priest, or deacon after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of deaconship taken, had ben conuict of fornication or aduoutrie. he was deposed, and cast out of the church, and enioined to do penaunce among the laitie. Which thing S. Syluester at length mercifully changed, enioining ten yeares penaunce after a prescript forme, which to our newe clergie would seme very hard and straight. Which penaunce if they refused to do, and had rather to continewe in their synne: then no body might be so hardy as to heare their seruice. So they of their owne accorde for fornications sake forsaking their seruice,<note place="margin">Dist. <hi>81.</hi> c. Siqui sunt.</note> for their offence were compelled against their will also to forsake their benefices. And thus euermore they that preferred their pleasure before their seruice, in any wise were remoued.</p>
                  <p>Yea further the lawe of the church in this case so litle beareth with the synnefull life of Clerkes, that, if any bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop in his dioces had consented and borne with the forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of priestes, or deacons, or with the crime of incest for money or prayer, or had not by auctoritie of his bishoply office, duly punished such faultes committed: the same should be suspended from his office. And that hath force
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:3928:170"/> at this daye, as of late in this our age it hath concerning this matter ben disputed, decreed, and determined, that it be not laufull for any man to bring in priestes that be notorious ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of concubines to exhibite the sacramentes, nor to geue or minister vnto them putting them selues forth to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate, necessary ornamentes.<note place="margin">Iacobus Hochstras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluta de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione sua de presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</note> For doing otherwise they should communicate with their synnes, whose blessing is tourned into curse, and praier into synne, whiles by the frendshippes of the laitie being made more negligent, they continewe in vices, and brought to be as men quite alienated from amendement, scantly thinke of the purpose to reforme their life. And this much we haue shewed touching the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing of a priest not only from his benefice, but also from his office for cause of fornication, wherein these men most falsely haue slaundered the church, as now to any man it may appere.</p>
                  <p>The third lye is, that Cardinall<note place="margin">c</note> Campegius,<note place="margin">A very false slaū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> Albertus Pighius, and certaine others haue taught, that a priest lyueth more holyly and more chastly that kepeth a Concubine, then he that hath taken a wife in matrimonie. Why do ye not tell vs where they haue taught so? Will ye that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue your bare word? How can we hauing taken you tardy in so many and so manifest lyes?<note place="margin">The gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of a common lyer by Aristotel.</note> Aristotel once asked what a common lyer gained by his lying, that (quoth he) when he telleth truth, no man will beleue him. Wisedom would syrs ye tooke good heede, that ye proue not such gayners. Now we require you to bring forth proufe of that ye charge these lerned men withall. We are sure ye can not. For we haue diligently reade their workes, specially where such argument is treated, and we finde no such vnreasonable doctrine by them auouched. Mary this we finde namely in Pighius, which ye meane doubtles, and which bewrayeth your false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed,
<pb facs="tcp:3928:171"/> that it is a lesse synne in a priest being ouercome with humaine frailtie to fall into fornication,<note place="margin">In what sense said Pighius to be a lesse sinne a priest to fall into fornicatiō th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

The wordes of Pighius be these. <hi>But put the case</hi> (saith he) <hi>they which haue vowed chastitie, all do not that they may and ought to do to atteine the grace of cōtinencie: and therfore they be not only tempted, but also ouercome with temptation for the more part.

                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.</note>
                     <hi>thou mayest not, which the Apostle imputeth to damnation, if they breake their first faith. For these (I saye) shall it be lesse euill, and lesse damnable to mary, then to be ouercome with lustes? See thou who is worse seruaunt, he that being weary with seruice, or perhaps vsing him selfe negligently and vnwarely falleth downe vnder his burthen, or he that casteth away the yoke alltogether? VVhich is worse scholer, he that lerneth that is put to him, not all (which peraduenture he could haue done had he not ouereaten and ouerslept him selfe) yet a part: or he that forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the scoole vtterly? Therefore we must resist temptation by such remedies as we haue spoken of. In which if at any time being remisse through infirmitie we fall, this is a more tollerable synne, then if we shake of our yoke altogether, yea and binde our selues with vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we against vowe made to God, and do not only not sustaine temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation nor tarye for it, but rather preuent it. Neither saye we thus, for that we allowe fornication. But we compare the falling by infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, to the deliberate, yea and the continuall incest, which these maried vowebreakers lyue in, all shame quite cast away.</hi> This far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Albertus Pighius.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Pighius shameles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belyed by the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note>Where (as ye see) he speaketh neuer a word of keping a concubine, much lesse teacheth he, that a priest which ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth a concubine liueth more holily and more chastly, then he that hath taken a wife in matrimonie. Of such as marye contrary to their vowe, he demaundeth whether they do a lesse euill, then others, that by negligence and infirmitie fall
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:3928:171"/> sometimes, and marye not. For, that they do better (saith he) we can not saye, for as much as S. Paul condemneth, who so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer breaketh his former promise. That such persons do much worse, he proueth by certain similitudes, cōparing the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by frailtie to a negligent seruant that falleth vnder his burthen, and to a scoler that for lacke of taking heede doth not canne al his lesson, but part: the other which do marye, to a seruant that breaketh awaye stubbornly from his maister, and shaketh of the yoke of seruice altogether, and to a scoler that runneth away and quite forsaketh the scole. Againe he calleth the fall of infirmitie <hi>tolerabilius peccatū,</hi> a more tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile sinne then mariage, where vowe maketh it vtterly vnlau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Finally,<note place="margin">In priestes that haue vowed chastitie, fornicatiō and mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age being both vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laufull, to marye is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.</note> we saye not this (saith he) for that we allowe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, but that in comparison of the other, that is farre more greuous. Thus it is easely sene, where, of two euils this lerned man calleth the one a lesse euill then the other, and of two sinnes the one a more tolerable sinne thē the other, that he would not either of them to be taken for good. Therefore where ye impute vnto him that he maketh the keping of a concubine to be a more holy and a more chast life in a priest, then taking of a wife in matrimonie, it is a fowle lye and a false slaunder.

But now we must consider the state of the citie of Rome laying all enuy and malice apart, as if we had to do with Venis, Millan, Florence, Naples, Paris, or any other like place where great resort is of diuerse nations: and then shall we finde Rome to be in no worse but rather in better case,<note place="margin">Harlots not dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen away for auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a greater euill.</note> then any other citie of lyke greatnes and situation is.

Who hauing she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed the hangman of his owne part perchaunce delighting in murder, yet to the right administration of the common weale to be requisite and necessarie, commeth straight to the case of harlots, whereof nowe we treate. His wordes are these. <hi>Quid sordidius &amp;c. VVhat can be said more vncleane, more void of comelines, more full of turpitude, then harltos, baudes, and such other like pestilences? Take harlots from among men, ye shall disturbe all thinges with lecherous lustes. Put the same in the stede of matrones, ye shall dishonest (all thinges) with spotte and shame. Let therefore this kinde of men which by their owne maners is most impure of life, be most vile in condicion by lawes of order. Are there not in the bodies of liuing and sensible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures certaine members, which if a man beholde alone, he can not abide to see, which notwithstanding the order of nature neither would to faile, because they are necessarie, neither to stand highest, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cause they are vnsemely? And yet those deforme thinges by keping
<pb facs="tcp:3928:175"/> their owne place haue yelded a better place to better thinges.</hi> Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to S. Augustine. By whose iudgement harlots do ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the order of the whole, whiles some certaine being by them selues placed in that vile seruice, in the meane time honest women liue the more void of temptation, and maintaine not vnder the pretence of matrones the filthy life of open quenes. Which for asmuch as it is so, I leaue to the due consideration of wise men, whether harlots may be wincked at for the eschewing of greater inconuenience, to haue their place with as litle slaunder in the citie of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, as in any other of the like condition and qualitie: And why the bisshop of Rome is to be blamed for that they be in Rome, more then the French king, the king of Spaine, or any other Prince, for suffering them in their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</p>
                  <p>It remaineth we seeke whether they haue also the lowest and vilest place in that Citie or no:<note place="margin">How courtisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes be pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ced and estemed in Rome.</note> lest perhaps although they be a necessarie euill, yet being promoted aboue their degree, they make an euill shewe in the bodie where they rest. Their place may be considered two wayes, in respect of the temporall, or of the ecclesiasticall order or lawe. For temporall order thus they stand.<note place="margin">Courtisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> Not to haue free libertie of dwelling in the most haunted stretes and palaises where them list, but only to be in such corners and bylanes and small outehouses, as are most fitte shoppes for the vile marchandize of such occupiers. Againe they can not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a very great forfeit ryde in coches or chariots as matro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes there do, but are constrained either to kepe their homely homes, or to walke a foote in the stretes. And then also by order they must be in such apparell, that, as Iewes by their red cappes, so they by their short vailes (a note of dishonestie) be knowen to all, and be subiect to all shrewdnes of the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:3928:175"/> boies of the stretes, who vse commonly to mocke and reuile them.</p>
                  <p>Concerning monye matters,<note place="margin">VVhat fauour they finde in mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> they paye all kinde of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes with the most, not so much to the prince (of whom they deserue no fauour) as to the Lord of the houses wherein they dwell, and to all others at whose handes they receiue thinges necessary. Who when they sell any their labours or wares to thē, make accompt to take so much the more of thē, by how much their good name commeth in hazard to be impaired for any though neuer so honest dealing with them.<note place="margin">The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the defenders towardes the Pope.</note> And here I can not but mislike with that malice which appereth besides all reason to be in the makers of this Apologie. For whereas it is a vertue in the prince to set greate burdens and paimentes vpon so filthy a profession, to the ende he may feare women from it, and make them the soner weary of it: they now (interpreting that he doth permitte harlots for lukers sake) seme to finde fault with the punishment of them, which if it were omitted, surely the prince were in very great fault. For as they are not dryuen awaye for the imperfectiō of naughty men, to saue other partes of the Citie whole: so must they be kept with lest fauour and in the vilest cōdition that may be, least their lewd order of life seme to be allowed. And yet these Defenders finde fault not so much with the hauing, as with the punishing of them. As who should saye, if ye must nedes tolerate them for ciuill policie, yet let them haue īmunities, priuileges, and honour ynough, that euen honest women may be entised with luker to folowe the like trade of life. In good sooth maisters ye are to yonge to controll the citie of Rome in her doinges.</p>
                  <p>But let vs come to the ecclesiasticall condition wherein these harlots do stand.<note place="margin">The ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition wherein courtisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes stand at Rome.</note> First it is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that who so euer comme to this deforme and synnefull
<pb facs="tcp:3928:176"/> order of life, be they men or women, it is not vnknowen to them, that they are in the state of mortall synne, whose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is damnation. For the case is not in Italie, as it is in Germanie, where fewe preachers crie out against the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly synne of dronkennes, either because they can not, as the more part of them being thereof giltye them selues, or dare not, because the people semeth incorrigible. It is farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in Italie. The preachers feare not to denounce to the kepers of concubines, to fornicatours, baudes and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, what horrible case they stand in. Verely nothing is there more common, then freely to warne them of the paines that belong to that kinde of synne, as they may wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,<note place="margin">Much preachīg in Rome against synne.</note> who list daily in the Lent there and on holydaies at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times, to heare the preachinges and lessons openly read in mo then a dousen churches at once against the kingdome of darkenes and iniquitie.</p>
                  <p>Neither is that thought sufficient. The Pope also vseth commonly both at the begynning of Lent and toward Easter, to denounce so much by proclamation set vp in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places of the Citie, forbidding them to communicate or to haue the rightes of holy church, except they will repent and amend and forsake that vnhonest and wicked profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Besides all this, if in that synnefull state they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinewe to their ende without repentance, it is not laufull for them to make any testament or last will for bestowing of their goodes, but as condemned and infamous persons they must leaue all to be confiscated and disposed at the Princes pleasure.<note place="margin">Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertites in Rome.</note> But on thother side, if they turne and repent, there are houses called the monasteries of the conuertites, and speciall prouision and discipline for them, where they are taught how to bewaile their vnchast life so synnefully past ouer. And if they who report the worst, would see
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:3928:176"/> or knowe all, or would be as glad to heare the clearing of the slaunder by them inuented, as they are ready to vtter it: I thinke they should finde this question of not bannishing harlots for to auoide a farther mischefe, to haue ben decided rather by the long experience of mans euill and synnefull behauour, then by any allowance for gaines to be made the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof. It is not only Rome they haue to do with, it is all the rest of Christendome, yea of all the world, more is the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.

Many argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes there be, by which this vanitie is confuted, of which here I will reherse a fewe. First this fable is disproued by the accompt of the time. They that haue written of the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Ioane the woman, make it to haue endured two ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res fyue monethes and three dayes, beside the vacation of one moneth. And they put the same betwen the time of Leo the fourth, and Benedictus the third.<note place="margin">Anastasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us biblio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecarius.</note> Now at that very time liued one Anastasius maister of the Romaine churches librarie, who wrote the lines of the Popes vnto Nicolaus the first, that succeded Benedictus the third, and was present, as him self sayeth, at the creations of Sergius the third, Leo the fourth,
<pb facs="tcp:3928:177"/> Benedictus the third, Nicolaus the first, Adrianus the second, and Ioannes the eight, which folowed in order one after an other. This lerned man Anastasius whose booke is to be sene, doth not only make no mention at all of Ioane the womans two yeres Popedome, but also writeth, that after the death of Leo the fourth, the Romaine see was vacant fiftin dayes only, and placeth after Leo the fourth, not one Iohn, but Benedict the third, as immediatly chosen to that see after the said Leo. Who listeth to see Anastasius his owne wordes, in Onuphrius shall he finde them. Thus is the fable wyped awaye of Pope Ioane by testimonie of the chiefe writer of that time. Onuphrius otherwise proueth by thaccompt of yeres and times, which is a sure waye of proufe, that none such nor any other besides these that be mēcioned, could haue bē two yeres in that see. Neither is that woman Pope spoken of by those that after Anastasius wro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te most diligently the histories, cronicles, and actes of times.</p>
                  <p>After Anastasius they that in their writinges recite an exact rewe and order of Popes, as Ademarus and Annonius of Paris, Regino, Hermanus Schafnaburgensis, Otho Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singensis, Abbas Vrspergensis, Leo bishop of Hostia, Iohan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Cremona, and Godfridus Viterbiensis, of which so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me wrote three hundred, some foure hundred yeres past, all these make no mention at all of this woman Pope Ioane. Againe there be in bibliotheca Palatina, at Rome six or seuen tables of the Popes names written in sundry bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes before the time of Innocentius the fourth. Among them all there is no Ioane woman Pope. Neither in the fiue olde bokes of Damasus the maister of the libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and of Pandulphus of Pisa, which treate of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes liues, is there any word written of Iohane the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Pope. Mary in the margent of Pandulphus this fable
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:3928:177"/> is put in betwen Leo the fourth and Benedict the third, written in a hande farre different from the olde characters of that auncient booke, added by some man of later time. Which maketh the matter to be the more suspected, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a fable.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore Leo the nynth who liued two hundred yeres after Leo the fourth,<note place="margin">The fable of Pope Ioane pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued to be vaine by good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> obiecteth to the Emperour Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael and to the clergie of Constantinople, that sometime they had promoted Eunuches or gelded men to that Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keship. He meant Nicetas and Ignatius. Which verely he would neuer haue obiected, had he knowen, that a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had once ben promoted to the see of Rome, and that in so fewe yeres before.</p>
                  <p>An other reason against the opinion of this fable, may be this. There was none made Pope laufully by the space of nyne hundred yeres after Peter the Apostle or there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, vntill Formosus the Pope, but from his youth he was brought vp in the church of Rome, and by the ecclesiasticall degrees of orders came to priesthod or deaconship at the left, as the same is manifest to those that marke the order of their succession, to haue ben obserued inuiolably. Then how could an vnknowen woman, of an vncertaine stocke and countrie, without holy order, and without any testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of former life, so vnaduisedly be made Pope? Though men had at that time ben so farre bewitched, and distract of their fiue wittes, as they could not haue knowen a woman from a man, (which no wise man I wene beleueth): yet it is not to be thought that God him selfe, who appointed and ordained the seate of Peter, whereof he would the whole church to be directed, would depart so farre from his merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prouidence toward the church, as to suffer the same to be polluted by a woman, which is not of capacitie for holy
<pb facs="tcp:3928:178"/> orders.</p>

Who wrote long after the time that Pope Ioane is fayned to haue lyued in. Whose maner of writing if we consider, we shall finde it vaine, and nothing like to be true. It begynneth thus. <hi>Iohannes Anglicus natione, Maguntinus, sedit annos duos, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sem vnum &amp; dies quatuor, &amp;c. Iohn an English man by nation, of Maguntia, sate</hi> (in the Romaine see) <hi>two yeres, one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and foure dayes, alias, fiue monethes and three dayes.</hi> What a foolish speach is this, an English mā Maguntine or of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gutia? As a man would saye, an English man borne, and a Douch man of Maguntia? For Maguntia is a Citie not in England, but of high Douchland. Platina hauing espied that absurditie, helpeth it of his owne head. It foloweth in the fable, as the said Martine telleth. <hi>This (as it is said) was a woman, and in the young age of a girle, she was brought to Athines by one that was her louer in a mans apparell, and there profited somuch in diuerse sciences, as none was found to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with her.</hi> To Athenes was she brought, saith the fable. And why?<note place="margin">Athenes destroyed.</note> For lerning. Very well. whereas at that time neither any Athenes stoode, neither was there any place of lerning there any lenger, but all the countrie of Attica be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came barbarous and vtterly voyde of lerning, as we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand by the writers of that time. The author reporteth, that from thence she came to Rome, and there professed ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning openly, and had great doctours to her scolers, and for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of lerning and good life, by one consent of all was made Pope. Which is sone confuted as false, for neither was any lerning at those dayes openly professed at Rome, as the stories declare, nor could she come to that honour by consent of all, where none knewe her before for such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:3928:178"/> as had passed through holy orders of the church. For then none were admitted to that see, but priestes or deacons that tooke orders and were brought vp in the church of Rome, as is aforesaid.</p>
                  <p>It foloweth in the fable. <hi>Bring in the Popedome she is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten with childe of her seruaunt. And not knowing the time of her delyueraunce, as she went from S. Peters to Laterane, strei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with paines betwen Colosseo and S. Clementes church, she brought forth and died, and was (as they saye) there buried.</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is to be marked how the deuiser of this fable bewrayeth him selfe, and thinketh the matter hard to be beleued. And therefore in the beginning saith, she was a woman <hi>(vt as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seritur) as folkes saye,</hi> and now he saith, she was buried, <hi>vt dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, as it is said.</hi> So he doth not affirme it to be true, but referreth all to hearesaye. By which testimonie lyes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly be soothed.</p>
                  <p>But why was she not with childe before her Popedome? And being so nigh her time, why kept she not in, lest her gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate belly should bewraye that she would to be secret? Was there none of her seruauntes, none of so great a courte, that had eyes to espie so euident a thinge? But some will saye, she kept her selfe in her secret places. Nay, sith that a litle before her time of deliueraunce she stickt not to go from S. Peters to Laterane, which is more then two english my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les; it is not likely that she kept her selfe very secrete befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. I thinke it is hard to make a wise man beleue, that all men there at that time became so voyd of sense, that none could discerne a woman from a man, by visage, voice, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures, and actes, yea a woman going nyne monethes with childe, susteining so many, pangues and griefes, as women in that case be subiect vnto. I leaue to aggrauate the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, that were likely to haue brought this matter
<pb facs="tcp:3928:179"/> to light. Verely the fable is such, as might well become Martin the monke to deuise it, or at the lest to tell it. For a man of grauitie and wisedome would neuer haue told it.</p>

                  <p>Touching the death of Iohn Diazius the Spaniard, ye
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:3928:181"/> tell many lyes at once. Alphonsus Diazius was not of purpose sent from Rome into Germanie to kill his brother Iohn. If any had borne him so much malice, it is likely he would haue committed that wicked seruice to an other, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to his owne naturall brother. That is one lye. That Alphonsus Diazius killed Iohn Diazius, that is an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lye. That Iohn Diazius was slayne only because he had embraced the gospell of Iesus Christ, and would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne againe to Rome: this is the third lye. And how could he returne to Rome where he was not before? That the said Alphonsus, after he had murthered his owne brother, was deliuered by the Popes meanes,<note place="margin">The truth touching Iohn Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azius de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ath.</note> to thend he might not be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by good lawes: this is the fourth lye. The truth he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof is this, as it is knowen by the confession of the person, that playd the worst part of this tragedie, who of late was alyue. Alphonsus Diazius a Spanyard, a lerned man in the lawes, came from Rome into Germanie for no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose for that is knowen, but to see his brother Iohn Diazius then mainteining his poore state by attending vpon a print. He had to accompanie him in that iourney, an other Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard named Iohannes Niger, a man of warre. After that all being done for which he came, he had taken leaue of his brother, they were not farre gone from the place, but this Iohn Niger bearing deadly hatred to Iohn Diazius, for his opinion as it is thought, which was not all together the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Iesus Christ: rode backe againe to the house where he remained, and geting the said Iohn Diazius to a secret place, killed him. That done he sped him selfe to Alphonsus, and they both rode awaye. Now whether Alphonsus cōsented to this murther or no, that neither ye, nor any man besyde them two knoweth. That he killed him not him selfe, though ye saye so, it is well knowen. The murther being knowen,
<pb facs="tcp:3928:182"/> horsemen made out after them, by whom they were taken, and brought to prison. Forthwith great sute being made for them both to Ferdinando of famous memorie then king of Romaines, late Emperour, in whose dominion they were apprehended: Alphonsus Diazius by meanes of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of Trent hauing his palais therby, was deliuered. Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes Niger, after he was condemned to dye, his pardon was procured by the ernest sute of certaine Spanyardes. Now as we detest the fact, so can not ye iustifie your vniust charging of others with the gylt of it. Neither haue ye any reason why this fact shuld derogate the catholike faith, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst which ye bring all that ye can.

When will ye forsake the scoole of lying, and leaue to saye, that Innocentius or any other for him proued the superioritie of the Pope, specially or chiefly because God hath made two lightes?

                  <p>Then after that Innocentius had by naturall reason and holy scripture proued the highest bishops superioritie aboue princes, he commeth in the hird place not now to proue, but to make his former saying already proued more plaine,<note place="margin">The allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the two lightes conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding to that is written in the beginning of Genesis. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Moyses declareth how God made two lightes in the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament of the heauen, a greater and a lesser. Now Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius farre better lerned then all our newe maisters of this late deuysed diuinitie, was not ignorant that heauen signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the scriptures the catholike church of Christ, and that those who rule others in this church, be as it were lightes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the blinde and sely wayegoers into their right waye either of going to heauen, either of liuing vertuously in this world.

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:3928:192"/> called him to the faith of Christ, be made to departe from that citie, which ruled the world, and to yelde his owne Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais partly a church to our sauiour Christ, partly a dwelling house for the bishops of Rome? Aske of Constantine, why he submitted his necke to S. Syluester. We haue cause to thinke, that Constantius the heretike sonne of Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, was not very glad of his fathers doing. And yet God suffered him not to retourne and dwell at Rome, but to lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue that Citie free to the rulers of the church. And we are su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re that ye be full angry with Constantine, and iudge him not so wise, as ye would haue ben in that case. But as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine left Rome to Syluester, so his faithfull successours neuer vsurped in matters ecclesiasticall any superioritie ouer the bishops of that see. Only so long as the people had a voice in chosing the Pope: it was reason the Emperour should much rather also haue his voice therein. But as the faith of Christ did more and more encrease, so did the light of Christes vicares true honour ouer the world spred abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de the brighter beames: and that by shaking of the yoke, which was vniustly put vpon the highest power in earth. For who shall be iudge of the chiefe iudge, as the fathers of the councell at Sinuessa said in the cause of Marcellinus, and yet ye finde fault, that now he is suffered to rule his ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne subiectes.</p>

When the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians came to a place and state of rest, God inspired into the hartes of the fathers and bishops euen of the primitiue church, to take and kepe such landes as were geuen to the churches.

For as both Aemylius and Platina do witnesse, the cause of their falling out was, that whereas the Pope being first sued vnto by Cassanus a Christian Prince and a great conquerour in the East to ioyne with him for the recouery of the holy land, sent the bisshop of Apamea to the French king for his necessary aide in that so common a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell of all Christendome: he being offended either that the sute was not first made to him, either for that the said bishop had done his Ambassade with shewe of more auctoritie,
<pb facs="tcp:3928:195"/> then the king thought it became him, or vppon some other priuate grudge, did not only vtterly refuse to send any helpe toward the voyage, but also cōtemptuously, beside common order, and cruelly, committed the Popes legate to prison, and there kept him, vntill such time, as through the Popes interdict, the king was compelled to set him at libertie. Now of geuing awaye his kingdom, this chiefe French histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographer maketh no mention. And if the Pope so did, why may he not seme to haue done it rather to feare him, and to reclaime his mynde from disobedience? Verely Platina writing it declareth, how before the Pope proceded to that extremitie, the French king did what in him laye, to withdraw the people of Fraunce from the obedience of the church and See Apostolike. All these thinges with euen iudgement weighed, that Pope semeth not so much worthy of the blame which by your maligne report ye charge him with, specially the occasion being first geuen of the kinges vnlaufull demeanour. But what soeuer may be iudged hereof, yea though the Pope therein be without all excuse, what is that to you? How serueth it you to any colour of excuse of your schisme, and cutting your selues from the rest of Christendome Christes mysticall bodye?</p>
                  <p>What ye saye of florence and Sauoye, we nede not care, sith ye proue nothing els, but that all Christen princes and common weales one way or other haue in all ages obeyed the see of Rome.<note place="margin">Sauoye was not spoiled by the Pope, nor by Charles the v. as the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders slaū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them.</note> That Sauoye was so much spoiled, ye are to blame to burthen either the Pope, or that worthy late Emperour Charles the fifth with it. Whereas ye professe lying and barking against Christes vicare, be he faulty or be he faultlesse, yet ye shuld haue spared a prince of so great worthynes, and of so famous memorie. The truth is, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoye substeined most harme by the french king, and by your
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:3928:195"/> owne good brethren the sacramentarie Suitzers of Berna, leuied and sent thereto in dede by king Frauncys of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me the first. Who tooke his aduauntage therein and vsed his best oportunitie, when the Emperour might not defend his frend the duke, as being occupied in other warres at Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in Afrike. Now that the Pope would ioyne with here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, and those of the worst sorte, which your selues are of, against that good and catholike Duke so derely beloued of the Emperour then absent, hardly (I wene) ye shall make it to any wiseman very credible.</p>

                  <p>All these (though ye scoffe neuer so much) were Popes, all were Peters successours, and notwithstanding any thing that ye can saye against them to the contrary without making a lye, all were holy fathers.

                  <p>For a reasonable and true answer to be made to sundry euill matters obiected to the Popes, it is to be considered, in what Emperours time ech one lyued, which is burthened with any thing that deserueth reproufe. For sometimes the

The flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers of wicked Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported vntruthes of good Popes to serue the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the times they ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in.</note> Of which the chiefe were Henry the third, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth, Frederike the first, the seconde, and Ludouicus of Bauaria. As these were great Princes, and such as oftentimes vsed lust for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and will for lawe: so had they flatterers, who for worldly preferment serued their euill desires, praised their wicked ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and spake euill of good Popes, that sought their amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Among them some haue not only spoken euill wordes of the Popes of their time, which passed away, as all wordes do: but also committed to writing their euill repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of them, which remaine. Which they did rather to serue the time, and procure them selues fauour in those courtes, then that them selues thought the thinges to be true, which they burthened thē with al. Againe when so euer lewde prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes in any countrie were restrained of their vngodly lustes, and put from their Concubines, whom they called their wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, as our holye gospellers do, and when so euer any schisme or heresie rose in the church: then were the Popes, who would not wincke at the iniquitie of their times, sure to be euill treated, to be railed at, to be openly reprehended and slaundered in bookes. Now as for loue commonly men praise some aboue the truth, so for hatred and euill will they blame many beyond desert. As the good nature beleueth the one rather then the other, so the wise man litle regardeth reproufes, when by examination of the occasions and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, he findeth the groundes whereof they spring. Such examination well and truly made, I doubt not but to good and wisemen most of the euill matters, with which of these Defenders or any other the professours of the newe gospell the successours of Peter are burthened, shall appere

Yf the Church saith he, shall depende vpon one manne, it will at once fall downe to the grownd. Who is he that seeth not how this is come to passe longe since?

I see well you would faine Gregorie had so writtē. And if he had, yet your argument had ben naught. For you take not the right <hi>minor,</hi> which should haue ben this, the church doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon one man, if you would make your reason good and after the rules of logike.

VVherefore if the B. of Constantinople be the vniuersall bishop according to the sense a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid, then at the fall of him from the faith, as when those two before named fell, the church also falleth, as then by this reason when they were bishops, it fell.</hi> Thus reasoneth S.

Alas, alas, o Lorde God, the selfe same persons be the chiefe in persecutinge thee, which seeme to loue the highest place, and beare moste rule in thy church.

S. Augustine in that booke disputeth against the Donatistes, who would restraine the catholike church to the only countrie of Aphrike, denying other Christen men to be members thereof. S. Augustine refuting their heresie,<note place="margin">VVe must holde both with the body and head, if we will be saued.</note> declareth the sonne of God to be head, and all the true faithfull to be the body of the church, and that it is not sufficient to holde with the head alone, or with the body alone: but we must holde with both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if we will be saued. The Donatistes did graunt the head Iesus Christ,<note place="margin">The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natistes heresie. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4.</note> and denyed his body the church. For this cause saith S. Augustine, <hi>Ipsum caput de quo consentimus, osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat nobis corpus suum de quo dissentimus. Let the head vpon whom we agree, shewe vnto vs his body, whereupon we disagree. The head is Christ, who spake first by his prophetes, afterward by him selfe, and last of all by his Apostles. In his igitur omnibus quaerenda est ecclesia.</hi>

                  <p>If thou marke good Reader that, which I haue here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hersed out of S. Augustine, it is to be sene, that he bindeth not the proufe of the church simply to the holy scriptures, but only in a case, when he hath to do with an heretike, who wil not admitte the auctoritie of the church. Therefore a true church may be founde, which is not shewed in the scriptures, so the contrarie thereof be not shewed in the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. For as when S. Augustine disputeth with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niches,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:3928:224"/> he sheweth their falsehed only out of those bookes of the newe testament which they will admitte, so disputing with the Donatistes, he must shewe the true church not by succession of the bishoppes of Rome, as he doth in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but (because the Donatistes denied that kinde of proufe as the heretikes of our time do) he must shewe it only out of the holy scriptures, to the intent he maye conuince them, by such principles, as them selues graunt.</p>
                  <p>Now if these Defenders will haue that to be no church which can not be shewed out of scriptures, they shall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that as therein they play the Donatistes, so we must nedes folowe S. Augustine in bringing scripture against them,<note place="margin">Proufes out of holy scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures that our new cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is not the true church. <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.26.28. <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. <hi>Esai.</hi> 49. <hi>&amp;</hi> 53. <hi>Esai.</hi> 2. <hi>Mich.</hi> 4. <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. <hi>Act.</hi> 1. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 16.14. <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. <hi>Luc.</hi> 8. <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.

                  <p>To proue therefore out of holy scriptures that their church is not the true church, thus we saye. God promised to Abraham, Isaac and Iacob, that all nations shuld be blessed in their sead, which is Christ. Who is set to be the light of the gentiles, and all nations shall see the saluation which is from God, and go vnto his holy hill, as being the heritage which Christ asked of his father. And for this cause he did will his Apostles to teach and baptise all nations, and to be his witnesses euen to the end of the earth. With whom he promised that him selfe and the holy ghost would remaine for euer. This church is a Citie buylded vpon a hill, which can not be hidde. A tabernacle placed in the sunne, a candel set not vnder a busshell, but on a candellsticke, which al men may see that enter into the house, or be within the house the pillour and ground of truth.</p>
                  <p>By these places it appereth that the church of God is eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb facs="tcp:3928:225"/> where dispersed, and euidently to be sene. But that church which now is set vp in England, had within these fyfty ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res no one chappell in the whole world, wherein it might serue God, after that vse and number of sacramentes, after that gouernement of the church and forme of faith, which now they kepe in England. It must nedes be an obscure companie, if it were any at all, whereof no bishop, no do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour or head, nor parish priest or parish clerke can be shewed fyfty yeres olde. They can not be the lightsome and shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning church of Christ buylded vpon the foundations of the Apostles and prophetes, which florisheth for euer. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it remaineth that it is the synagog of Antichrist, and Lucifer. Who as he fell out of heauen like a lightning, so he maketh a blaze and shewe of a church in the earth for a time. But as we can tell when it was not borne, so shall it not be long, but that through Gods power it will vanish a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye, dispersed and be scattered by the lightsome maiestie of Christes true church, which from S. Peters time to this daye florisheth in her head the bishop of Rome, and in her mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers throughout the worlde, which abyde in the vnitie of the same bishop.</p>
                  <p>Our aduersaries perceiuing well they haue no good grounde to staye vpon, would make the world beleue, that for this our glorious church, we had no scriptures. They laye to our charge, that we call the scriptures a colde, vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, vnprofitable, domme, killing and dead letter. But this is a slaunder,<note place="margin">The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence which the catho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>likes bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to the scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</note> as many other in their Apologie are. The scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures we reuerence a great deale more then they do, as the thing it selfe will beare witnes. We first exhort euery man to prepare him selfe both by cleanes of life, and exercise of tonges and ernest study, before he come to read or expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unde the holy scriptures. They prostitute them as baw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:3928:225"/> do their harlottes, to the vnlerned, vngodly and rascall sorte of men, without any discerning of what disposition they be. We suffer no man though he be well lerned and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, to buylde any thing vpon the scriptures, except he haue either some of the olde fathers, or practise of the church for his guyde and interpretation. They seeke in them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but newe toyes, carnall libertie, breach of order, and contempt of antiquitie. We esteme and vnderstand the scriptures to be the sense and the word.<note place="margin">The scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is the sense and word not the bare word only.</note> If they can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende the bare word, they thinke them selues good ynough to make a sense of their owne. Which bare word as they misuse it, Pighius perhaps compareth to a nose of waxe. But the scriptures he neuer meant to dishonour with that similitude. If it were laufull for vs to vse scripture after our owne interpretation as they do, we should not lacke suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient matter in the holy bookes to ouerthrowe by our owne applying all their false opinions and heresies. But we are bounde to that religious awe and reuerence of them, that except we haue an authour to auouch the sense where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we take holde, we dare bring forth nothing. And yet read our bookes who will, he shall lacke neither scriptures in them, nor witnesses of our interpretation in any controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of this age. Let it be agreed that for decision of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies such sense of the scriptures be taken for scripture, which the holy ghost hath taught the church, and then let the world iudge, who flyeth the worde of God, as the thefe doth the gallowes, we, that alwaies require them to be tryed by the scriptures, as they are by the fathers expounded, or they, who boast of the bare word of the scripture, and that as them selues vnderstand it: then shall it appere, whether part like the Cantharus loseth his force and power in the swete balme of gods worde.</p>

                  <p>First I note with what fidelitie these newe holy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren do their thinges.<note place="margin">The best that may be said for this Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> It maye be thought that the secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of this newe clergie at his penning of the Apologie sawe not Hosius booke of the expresse worde of God. But as they haue ben conuersant in S. Augustine, Hierome, Chry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sostom and the auncient fathers, so vse they Hosius at this time: that is to saye, they read neither the olde fathers with any diligence, neither the writers of our time. But by snap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes and peaces either them selues write out here and there a lyne or two, or vse that which some of their owne secte hath taken out of them. So that for most part they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer knowe the true meaning of the place, whiche they alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. But vsing patched note bookes, and bringing in scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered authorities, they be deceiued them selues,<note place="margin">An excuse fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly cōcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders vniust charging of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius.</note> and deceiue others. After this sorte they fell on some note booke ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de out of Hosius, where the said wordes that they burthen
<pb facs="tcp:3928:227"/> him with, were written. And he that tooke the note, kne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we well they were not the wordes of Hosius, and did but only put the name of Hosius vnto them, because they we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re taken out of his booke. The writer of this Apologie not knowing or not remembring so much, when he founde in the note booke the name of Hosius with such wordes, he dyd rashly put them in print to his owne great shame and discredite. If this excuse be not true, we must nedes laye maruelous malice to the said writer, who wittingly and of set purpose did impute these wordes to Hosius, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by waye of misliking of them, and shewing whose heresie they conteined.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie is of necessitie to be char<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, for the slaū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Hosius. The wōt of hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes depre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hended in falsehed.</note>Now let the Defenders chose whether they will haue their secretary condemned of ignorance, or of malice. How so euer it be, marke yet the third point, which hereof we wil gather. The Apologie was skant printed and published, but that grosse errour was out of hande espied, and word there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of brought to the authour, I meane him that penned it. But what did he? Did he confesse that he was deceiued? Did he crie Hosius mercie? No, no. That is not the wont of heretikes. They will go foreward with the matter once begone, what so euer come of it. What did he then? When it should be set forth in english, and word came to hym thereof, he made an excuse, I warraunt you meete for an heretike, whose propertye it is <hi>proficere in peius,</hi> as S. Paul sayeth, to procede to worse and worse, to take his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree backeward, and of agreat fault to make a farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.<note place="margin">How this Defender amended his fault.</note> For whereas before (as charitie moueth me to thinke) he had made an errour, supposing Hosius to haue said that which he had not, afterward by stubborne mainteining of it, he sheweth what spirite he is of. And when he might reasonably haue excused his ignorance, chose rather spite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:3928:227"/> to discouer his malice. As it shall manifestly appere by the circūstance of the thing. He laieth to Hosius charge, and in his person to all our charges, that we do not esteme the holy scriptures. He proueth it by certaine wordes allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out of a treatise made by Hosius <hi>de expresso verbo dei.</hi> The wordes are here put in the Apologie,<note place="margin">The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of Hosius boke <hi>De expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so verbo dei.</hi>
                     </note> as the reader may see. The true argument of Hosius booke is no other then to shewe, that all heretikes haue alleaged the wordes of God, as they be writtē. But none of them all haue taken the right vnderstanding of Gods wordes, as they do in dede signifie. For that only the catholike church atteineth vnto, because only it hath the holy Ghost. All heretikes haue brought for their opinions the written word of God so long, vntill at the last (sayeth Hosius) there were founde, who by the wordes of the scriptures toke vpon them to take away al au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoritie frō scriptures. <hi>Natum est</hi> (sayeth he) <hi>nouūquoddā pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetarū genus, qui non sunt veriti scripturarum auctoritate scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turis auctoritatem omnem detrahere, en quo perduxit rem tandem Satanas. A certaine newe kinde of prophetes is risen, who sticke not by the auctoritie of scriptures to take away all auctoritie from scriptures.</hi> See whether at the lenght the deuil hath brought the matter.</p>
                  <p>Now afterward expounding this matter more at large, he declareth the capitaine of that heresie to haue ben Zwenfeldius. He sheweth that by a text of scripture where Dauid saith, <hi>I will heare what our lorde speaketh in me:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 48.</note> Zwēck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feldius went about to wil mē to heare what God telleth eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man by inspiration, rather then to geue attendance to the written word of God. And whiles Hosius reporteth what Zwenckfeldius said for the maintenance of his fond heresie, among other his wordes these are, which be brought in this Apologie against Hosius and against the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
<pb facs="tcp:3928:228"/> whereas it is neither Hosius nor any Catholike that speaketh them, but only Zwenckfeldius him selfe. As well might he haue appeached the auncient fathers of heresies, because in sundry places of their workes, they alleage the wordes of the heretikes, whom they confute. So should <hi>S.</hi> Basile be made an Eunomian, S. Ambrose an Arian, S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine a Pelagian. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto we haue shewed that the wordes alleaged in the Apologie vnder the name of Hosius, make neither against him, nor against vs, as not being his wordes nor ours, but only the wordes of Zwenckfeldius. Well, what credite maye we geue to this man in expounding the word of God,<note place="margin">Hosius cleareth him selfe of the false sla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>under ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de vpon him by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, before the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie was written.</note> (whose true meaning he may falsifie at his pleasure because we can not bring forth God him selfe to declare his wordes) seing he dareth to burthen Hosius, with these wordes, which Hosius him selfe being yet alyue can declare to haue an other meaning, as the booke it selfe doth witnesse to all that list to read the same. This was a great fault to impute so horrible an heresie to Hosius vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustly. This was a great ignorance to charge him with that heresie, which he refuteth and impugneth. They are great crimes, and yet such, as might rise of misreport and ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce. But when he was tolde of them, he should of reason haue corrected them. He should haue repented with Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and not despaired with Cain and Iudas.</p>

If he had fauoured their heresie, what neded he to refell it? But how say you, that Hosius dissembleth and hydeth what he is, sith that euen here in two places in most plaine wordes you laye the Zuenckfeldian heresie to his charge? Read your owne booke. Before thallegation of Zuenckfeldius heresie, saye you not thus? <hi>We, sayth hee, will bid away, &amp;c.</hi> And after thallegation, haue you not these wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. <hi>This is Hosius saying?</hi> How standeth all this together? You haue forgoten the prouerbe, that biddeth a lyer to be myndefull. I can not tell how to name this kinde of your dealing, lying, or detraction, slaundering, or malicious spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. But Sir if Hosius haue spoken euill, why geue you not witnes against him of euill? If he haue spoken well, euen by your owne confession in reputing the Zuenckfeldians for heretikes, why finde you fault with him for his good wordes, such I saye, as your selfe confesse to be good? You reproue him who speaketh not against Zuenckfeldius, and againe you graunt he speaketh against him, and yet because you had once reproued him, you will continewe in it without reason, lerning, or witte. But it must nedes so be, for without partinacie no man is either a perfite heretike, or a perfite slaunderer.</p>
                  <p>I am sure this one dede can be iustified by no honest man, although he were but a naturall politike citizen, who should haue the iudgement of the matter. Seing you haue belyed Hosius in print, aske him forgeuenes in print. But you are so farre from that humilitie, as you are from the loue of the catholike religion. Yea rather ye sticke not to ioyne an other lye to it, and that in print also, to make excuse of your former offence, by committing a more greuous offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.
<pb facs="tcp:3928:229"/> If yet you stand in defence of it, all the world will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt you for a desperat person. For no man that euer sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we Hosius workes, can thinke that he was gylty of that you burthen him with. But some man might thinke you were deceiued and mistooke Hosius. But sith you graunt, you do not now mistake him, and yet charge him with auouching that which he hodleth for heresie: he that vnderstandeth this much of you, may assure him selfe, that you are disposed to belye and slaunder Hosius, though it cost you the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your soule. For shame man repent and reuoke that for which your owne conscience stinteth not to barke at you. But this greueth me somewhat more then your selfe. How founde so many flatterers in their hartes to kepe you from making amendes by confession of your default, that they also mainteine you in it? For the man who trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated your booke, and likewise the woman semeth to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to your fault. And how many mo were accessary to it God knoweth. Beleue me you seme to haue neuer a frend in England.<note place="margin">An eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a true frend.</note> For if you had but one, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer leaue you, vntill you had promised him to amend this great enormitie. It is a fowle matter for a Superintendent to be a slaunderer of set purpose and wilfull malice, to go from ignorance to stubborne defence, to heape one synne vpon an other.</p>
                  <p>All the booke of Hosius <hi>de expresso verbo Dei,</hi> declareth, that he doth reuerence the holy scriptures, as he ought to do. If you list not to read it all ouer, see but one place where he sayeth by waye of an obiection against him selfe after this sorte.<note place="margin">That Ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sius reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renceth the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it is proued by Hosius</note>

Hast thou therefore brought forth these many thinges, to thintent thou mightest shewe him to be an heretike, if any man did vse the witnes of scripture?</hi> To this demaund he answereth after this sort. <hi>Proculae nobis absit, vt vel cogitemus haec, quae sunt ab homine Christiano aliena.

                     <hi>who iudged heresie to come from the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, not from the scripture.</hi> Then if Hosius detest that opinion, which you impute vnto him, why do you by your impudencie in this matter betraye an other pryuy fault of yours, which is that you will not go from that you haue once said, though you perceiue it to be neuer so false: but with a newe lye farre worse fortifie the former lye?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But how then,</hi>

                     <hi>yf Zwenkfeldius make exclamation on the other syde, and saye that the same very wordes be not his but Hosius own wordes? For tell me where hath Zwenkfeldius euer written thē? Or if he haue written them, and Hosius haue iudged the same to be wicked, why hath not Hosius spoken so much as one worde to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute them? Howsoeuer the mater goeth, although Hosius paraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will not allowe of those wordes, yet he doth not disallow the meaning of the wordes.

What if Zuenkfeldius crye out (saith he) that they be not
<pb facs="tcp:3928:230"/> his, but Hosius his owne woordes? Whereby he meaneth as we gesse, that Hosius faineth these wordes vpon Zuenk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feldius. If this much had ben put in the latine Apologie at the first, it might haue come to the knowledge of Hosius, and him selfe would haue declared, how he came by these wordes, and whether he had them by most faithfull report of mouth, (which kinde of instruction Epiphanius writing against heresies sometimes vsed) or founde them written in latine by any man, or translated them out of the Douch tonge, as he might take them out of diuerse writers. This is more then probable, that Hosius lyuing in Prussia among the Germaines, would not be so bolde, as to make an open lye vpon any of them in his publike writinges. He hath more regard of his honour then so to do. Would God ye had some like regard of your honestie.<note place="margin">witnesses of Zuenk<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feldius heresie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius by whom Hosius is clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of charge of slaunder.</note> Now the same thing that Hosius layeth to Zuenkfeldius, also Fridericus Staphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus witnesseth to haue ben his heresie. And Flacius Illyricus hath written fyue bookes against the said Zuenkfeldius in the Douch tōge, as Hosius reporteth in his first booke against Brentius. Where also he putteth the wordes, which Zuenk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feldius vsed with his owne scolers. Moreouer Philip Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanchthō in a certaine preface before parte of his workes, reporteth his doctrine (as Hosius sayeth) to drawe men from the reading and thinking of written scripture to inspiration. I thinke these are sufficient meanes to cleare Hosius from suspition of slaundering Zuenkfeldius.<note place="margin">The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Zuenk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feldians to be here<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tikes, and yet they charge Hosius for saying so.</note> But what nede we so many witnesses? Do not your selues in your Apologie acknowledge the Zuenkfeldians for monstrous heretikes? If it be laufull for you so to accompt them, what reason or witte is it, to lay that to Hosius charge, which ye do your selfe? But lyers many times contrary to thaduise of tholde prouerbe, forgete them selues.</p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:3928:230"/>
                  <p>But let vs graunt that ye mistrusted whether Hosius ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused Zuenkfeldius iustly or no. Was that a sufficient cause why ye should burthen him to haue thought the same thing, which he reproued in an other? Is your backebyting excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed thereby? Admitte that Hosius being sure of Zuenk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feldius heresie, did in his owne latine wordes set it forth at large. What can you make thereof? It is knowen the same is an heresie. Your selues confesse it and condemne it. So doth Hosius likewise. And yet would you make vs beleue, that Hosius him selfe thought so? Yea saye you, for he hath not spoken so much as one word to refute his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. This is an other of your lyes.<note place="margin">He that calleth Zuenkfel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dius an heretik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>, speaketh against his here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.</note> For when he sheweth it to be an heresie to saye as Zuēkfeldius did, I suppose it is one word, that may seme to refute it in a Christen mans eares. so farre as a lerned mans condemnation is a confutation. I am sure you saye no more against it in your Apologie. And because otherwise ye confute it not, nor certaine other heresies, as Mennonians, Anabaptistes, Libertines, &amp;c. were it reason therefore to charge you with the maintenāce of thē?</p>
                  <p>Well to answer somewhat for Hosius,<note place="margin">A place alleaged out of Hosius pertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of zwenk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feldius.</note> read the lerned boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke which Hosius wrote against Brentius, and there shall you fynde Hosius to saye this much of Zuēcfeldius, <hi>Excogitauit &amp; ipse nouā haeresim, ac scripturarū nixus praesidio, scripturis au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoritatē omnē abrogare conatus est. Zuencfeldius also for his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te hath deuised a newe heresie, and leaning to the help of scriptures, went about to take away all auctoritie from the scriptures.</hi> All these wordes he bestoweth to thintent we shuld beware of his heresie. Which may seme to any man of iudgement to make somewhat on Hosius behalfe for confutation of Zuenkfeldius heresie.</p>
                  <p>But yet let vs see a farther refutation thereof. The pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce is somewhat long. I will recite it in English out of the
<pb facs="tcp:3928:231"/> first booke contra Brentium. For whereas Zuenkfeldius brought for his opinion out of S. Paul,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13</note> that place where the Apostle conferreth the knowledge of this present life which is vnperfite, with the perfite knowledge which shall be in the life to come: Hosius sayeth, that these men wrest such thinges to this life, applying that, which S. Paul nameth knowledge in a part, to holy scripture, and that which he calleth perfite, to the reuelations of the spirite as though when a man is come to reuelations, that which is a peece of knowledge (which was by Zuenfeldius the handeling and vse of scriptures) were by reuelations taken awaye. Is not this the refutatiō of Zuēkfeldius, or at least is it not one word towardes the refutation of him? He that listeth maye see more in the said booke against Brētius. Whereas the good life of the Zwenkfeldiās was wel reported and praised in the presence of Hosius at Charles the late Emperours courte, Hosius fearing least that report might infect some mā, saieth, the Deuil chāgeth him selfe into an Angell of light, that by the shadowe of holynes he maye deceiue that simplicitie of the hearers. And yet Hosius semeth to you to fauer the Zwenkfeldians, because he likeneth them to the Deuill.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Hosius reckeneth zwenck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feldius with hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes.</note>Furthermore in the very booke <hi>de expresso verbo dei,</hi> he reckeneth Zwenkfeldius with Marcion, Photinus, Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Sabellius, Manichaeus, Luther and Zwinglius. And yet these men he not a shamed to beare the world in hand, as though Hosius were a Zwenkfeldian. They are so good in the arte of lying, that their scolers wil not sticke to saye hereafter, that Hosius was a Zuinglian, and thought as Caluine did of all thinges, not withstanding his worthy writinges, in which he hath spent the better part of his age, against them. For at the lest they will make surmise, that at his death he recanteth, as they haue and do report of sundry
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:3928:231"/> lerned catholike men, namely of doctor Pendilton in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, of Picus Mirandula of Italy, of D. Clingius preacher of Erford in high Almaigne, of Latomus of Spire, of D. Gropperus of Coulen, and last of all of the late most catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Emperour Ferdinand of famous memorie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But Hosius</hi> (saye they) <hi>peraduenture will not allow the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of Zuenkfeldius, yet he doth not disalowe the meaning of the wordes.</hi> Well and clerkly reasoned. As though wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des were allowed or dissallowed for any other so principall a cause, as for theire meaning. And therefore he that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salloweth wordes, hath much more disallowed the meaning of them. Yet, (saye they) of the holy communion vnder both kindes he reiecteth the plaine worde of Christ as dead and colde elementes. Verely a man might thinke this boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke was set forth by some ennemye of our newe english cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, it is so much to their defacing, had not them selues at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse times acknowleged it for a whelpe of their one lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. A man for his life can not finde one lefe in it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out many lyes. Where doth Hosius reiect Christes wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des? I knowe where he reiecteth your wordes, who saye that both kindes are to be geuen to all the laie by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement and institution of Christ. But Christes wordes he maketh a farre more accompt of, then ye do. For he sayeth they were spoken to the twelue Apostles, with whom only he sate downe, as the gospell sheweth. And ye pretende they were spoken to all men and women. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he any iote diminish the estimation of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Touching that for which ye reproue Pighius, he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that we can not knowe, which are true scriptures, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the church hath shewed them vnto vs. And before we knowe them, we can not expresselye geue credite vnto their sayinges. For diuerse heretikes haue gone about to set forth workes of their owne making or corrupting vnder the name of scripture, and would haue geuen them thauctoritie of scripture. But not contenting your selues with this great iniurie done to Hosius, ye come also to do a greater to all the catholikes, saying that they hate and burne the holy scriptures.

Burthen vs nomore with such slaunders, lest when they are turned vpon your selues, ye repent your folie to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te.

                  <p>You are much troubled with the chest of the Popes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, wherein he is thought to haue all lawes.<note place="margin">Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> At this you scoffe foure or fyue times in your Apologie, medling with a matter that you vnderstand not. For it is a lawiers phrase. Who presupposeth the prince of euery common weale to knowe the lawe of the same,<note place="margin">The chest of the Popes breste.</note> no lesse then if it were written in his breaste. And therefore when he maketh a newe lawe, he repealeth the former lawe, whereunto the later is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And whereas one might saye, he remembred not his former law at the making of his later, and therefor except in his last he make special mēcion of the first, the same should stande in his force: hereunto answer is made, that although mention be not made of the first, yet it is repealed by the later lawe, being contrary vnto it. And why? Because who
<pb facs="tcp:3928:236"/> so euer hath power to make a newe lawe, is presumed alwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes to haue the olde law of the same common weale before his eyes. For though him selfe haue it not in remembrance, yet the lawiers that be of his councell can not be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myndefull thereof. And how so euer it were, yet it should not be thought, the Prince were ignorant of his owne lawe.</p>
                  <p>These be the wordes of Bonifacius the Pope, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long not only to him, but to all Princes and magistrates, who haue auctoritie to make lawes.<note place="margin">De constit. in sexto. c. <hi>1.</hi>

The bishop of Rome, who is thought to haue all lawes in the chest of his breste, by making the second lawe, is knowen to reuoke the first, although he make no mention of it.</hi> What is here to be laughed at? Reproue the matter if you can. The briefe summe of that chapter made by Ioannes Andreae a lerned Lawier is this. <hi>Noua constitutio principis tollit primā contrariā, quamuis id nō exprimat. The new lawe of the prince taketh away the former lawe being contrary, although it expresse not so much.</hi> The reason of this rule is, because the prince is presumed to haue as it were within the cheft of his brest all his owne lawes. The Pope being a prince also for his part (greater then the ennemies of vnitie would he were) made a secōde lawe, which reformed the former contrary lawe, by the force of this principle. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we come these felowes, and either not vnderstanding the matter, or maliciously abusing it, ceasse not to scoffe at the Pope, for the chest of his bosome.

But if ye preach a gospell which ye haue receiued of no Apostle nor Apostolike preacher, and which was not heard of in the earth, when Luther ranne out of his cloistre, and forsooke his religion: then be ye assured, that ye are the men, who are holden for accursed of S.

And yet you are not ashamed to alleage that out of S. Paul for your tourned gospell, which maketh most against you. For what maner of gospell is that you alleage? Is it a recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued gospell? No, beware that. For that is the papisticall gospell. They who gaue you your baptisme, neuer gaue you that gospell, whereby Christes body in the blessed sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is made an idoll, wherby the most high sacrifice of the Masse is condemned and called a strompet, whereby the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sacramentes of the church are misprised.

So that from S. Paul to this daye there must be a continewing preaching and receiuing of one and the same gospell.

                     <hi>But how if the thinges whiche these men are so desirous to haue seeme newe, be found of greatest antiquitie? Contrariwise, howe if all the thinges well nye, whiche they so greatly set out with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of antiquitie, hauing been well and throughly examined, be at lenght founde to be but new, and deuised of verye late? Southly to say, no man that had a true and right consideration, would think the Iewes lawes and cerimonies to be new for all Hammans accusation: for they were grauen in very auncient Tables of most antiquitie. And although many did take Christ to haue swarued from Abraham and the old fathers, and to haue brought in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine newe religion in his owne name, yet aunswered hee them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly: Yf ye beleeued Moses, ye woulde beleeue me also, for my doctrine is not so new as you make yt. For Moses an author of greatest antiquitie, and one to whome ye geue al honor, hath spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of me. Paul likewise, though the Gospell of Iesus Christe be of many counted to be but new, yet hath it (saith he) the testimonie most old, both of the law and prophetes. As for our doctrine whiche wee may rightlier cal Christes catholik doctrine, it is so far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re of from newe, that God who is aboue all most auncient, and the father of our Lorde Iesus Christe, hath left the same vnto vs in the Gospell, in the prophets and Apostles woorkes, beinge monuments of greatest age. So that no man can nowe thinke oure doctrine to be newe, onlesse the same thinke either the prophetes faith, or the Gospell, or els Christe him selfe to be newe.</hi>

For in the simple vowe there is nothing but a promise made to God without any deliuerance of that thing, which was promised. But in mariage the man and woman by present acceptation of ech others bond, do make the matter to extende beyonde the nature of a promise.<note place="margin">Mariage after so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lēne vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not.</note> Therefore if likewise the vowe made to God were not a simple promise, but also a deliuering of the thing promised: then can not the mariage folowing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke void the vowe, which was not only promised, but also performed. The performance is, when he that voweth, doth professe him selfe in the handes of his superiour by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the habite of some religion, or by receiuing holy orders of the bishop. For in that solemne act he delyuereth vp all his owne right and power, so that now he is not maister of him selfe to geue his body to any person in mariage, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise. You should knowe by the lawe of nature, if you
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:3928:245"/> would consider it, that if I promise a horse to one man, and afterward promise the same and deliuer him to an other: that the second man is true Lord of that horse, although I haue done iniurie to him, to whom I made the first promise. For the promise with the delyuery, is more vaileable to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre my right in the horse, then my promise alone. Euen so it is a great synne to breake a simple vowe of chastitie made to God. But that notwithstanding if before my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession I deliuer myselfe in mariage vnto any person, by the lawe of nature (which is the lawe of God) I am bound to abyde in mariage. But if first I delyuered my selfe in a solemne consecration of my person (as monkes and priestes do) then mariage in fact folowing is none in lawe.</p>
                  <p>S. Augustine speaketh of a simple vowe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the same distinction from whence you alleage S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines wordes, it foloweth immediatly.<note place="margin">

                  <p>Chrysostom Hom. 2. in Math. speaketh against them, which contemned the scriptures, and said they were no monkes, but had wiues and children and care of householde. As though it perteined not to maried men to reade any part thereof, but to monkes only.

                  <p>Last of all the fifth lye is to saye, that we pronounce our seruice and our mysteries in a barbarous tongue.

It is otherwise when we preach. For then we teach the people, and speake to them only. But in our publike praiers we saie the cōmon seruice of all the West church, and not only the seruice of England.

But let vs heare what Pope Iulius sayeth. <hi>Cum omne crimen atque peccatum oblatis Deo sacrificijs deleatur, quid de cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tero pro delictorum expiatione Domino dabitur, quando in ipsa sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificij oblatione erratur?

                  <p>Ye will saye perhaps, I do you wrong, because ye brought not forth this place which I haue alleaged. Nay syrs I do as I am constrained, for that it ioyneth with that part which ye alleage. And it is not euen dealing to alleage one peece, and kepe backe the other, which helpeth to the vnderstanding of the whole. Well, hitherto ye haue small aduantage of Pope Iulius. Let vs see what foloweth. <hi>Audiuimus enim quosdam schismatica ambitione detentos contrà diuinos ordines, &amp; Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas institutiones, lac pro vino in diuinis sacrificijs dedicare.

And when the priestes in some coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries either for lacke of wine at all times ready, either for some priuate fansie vsed to dippe or stipe the sacred body of our Lord vnder forme of bread in the consecrated bloud, and so to geue it to the people: Pope Iulius findeth fault therewith, for that neither Christ ordeined so, nor the Apostles left such order to the church. So that Iulius meaneth nothing els, but to reproue and reforme that vse of dipping or styping the one kinde in the other in the administration of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion vnto the people. Reade the place who listeth, he shall finde the same sense more largely vttered a litle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>But what sense make these Defenders a Gods name? They saye <hi>Iulius forbiddeth the priest,</hi>

Iulius nameth eucharistiam, they call it bread. Iulius hath <hi>intinctam por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigere populis,</hi> that no priest geue the sacrament dipped to the people, they leauing out geuing it to the people, saye he forbad the priest to dippe it. They leaue out also the chiefe cause of the whole, which is, <hi>pro complemento commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionis, for making vp of the communion.</hi> For he forbiddeth to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:3928:257"/> geue vnto the people only the consecrated hoste dipped in the chalice, as though it were the whole communion, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse then if the bloude were geuen aparte. These men (saye they) contrary to the decree of Pope Iulius, diuide the bread, and dippe it in the wine. We in the masse breake the hoste in three partes not without signification of a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie, two we receiue apart, the third we put into the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and receiue it together with the bloud. What haue ye to saie against this? Neither is this that Iulius reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. He forbiddeth to geue vnto the people the blessed Sacrament dipped. We neither do it, nor euer haue done it. Iulius would not the dipping to stand for the supplying of both kindes apart, and for the making vp of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Neither do our priestes in the masse in that sense take it, nor to that ende vse it: but for signification only of a speciall mysterie, and that not of a priuate fansie or ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but by publike auctoritie. And therefore that decree of Iulius perteineth not to the reproufe of any thing, that now is done in the church.</p>

Ye must vnderstand the councell of Trent was not ended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the yere of our Lord 1563. and not confirmed vntill the yere. 1564. from which time one yere is geuen to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blication thereof.

With what face finde they fault with the pluralitie of benefices of one man, who among their owne secte accompte it not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laufull one man to haue two sundry bishoprikes?

But how so euer it be, and whether we offend in this point or no, yet we kepe and mainteine a godly doctrine as touching the same. They for their part, as they offend in the thing, so doctrine for due order of it, haue they none. So vnperfite is yet their newe vpstart church.</p>
                  <p>That ye saie catholike bishops come not in the pulpit, it is a slaunderous lye. For it is otherwise, though some here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in be faulty, and that they thinke it not any part of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:3928:259"/> it is a malicious and to incredible a lye. Albeit some bishops I trow, ye will hold excused for this behalfe.

                  </p>
                  <p>Let S. Bernard writing to a Pope answer for the Pope. He is a sufficient witnes. Where your selfe do alleage him much against the Pope, you can not by the lawe iustly refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se him speaking for the Pope. The spirituall sword you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie not I trowe. Of the temporall sword belonging also to the Pope, thus saieth S. Bernard to Eugenius. <hi>He that denyeth this sworde to be thine, semeth to me not to consider suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently the word of our Lord saying thus (to Peter thy predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour) Put vp thy sword in the scaberd. The very same then is also thine to be drawen forth perhaps at thy becke, though not with thy hande. Els if the same belonged in no wise vnto thee, where as the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:3928:260"/> Apostles said, beholde there be two swordes here:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Our Lord would not haue answered, it is ynough, but it is to much. So both be the churches, the spirituall sworde, and the materiall. But this is to be exercised for the church, and that of the church. That by the hande of the priest, this of the souldier, but verely at the becke of the priest, and commaundement of the Emperour.</hi> Thus touching the Popes both swordes, you are fully answered by S. Bernard. I trust you will not be so vncourteous, as to put him besyde, being so often alleaged by your selfe and them of your syde: nor so parciall, as to allow him when he semeth to make so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me shewe for you, and to refuse him, when he is founde plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne contrary to your false assertions.</p>

If the death of a sonne be so greuous a punishment to a good father, that king Dauid was content to praye, to faste, to lie on the ground, afflicting him selfe seuen dayes, only to trie whether he might as it were by exchaunge bye out the death of his sonne, and yet so could not obteine his desire: we may be most certain, that the very best frendes of God synning after baptisme (or circuncision which in the olde lowe stode in place thereof) must by ordinary course satisfie with some temporall affliction that iust iudgement of our mercifull maker and redemer, if farther grace be not founde by some other waie. This satisfaction<note place="margin">Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> hath ben there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore iustly called the third and last part of penaunce. Which if it be not fullfilled in this life, vndoubtedly it shall be straightly exacted in the world to come in the fyre of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory. For that synnes may be in an other world forgeuē to those who die not in the deadly bondes of them, our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our hath geuen vs to vnderstand, saying,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Math.</hi> 12.</note>
                     <hi>that the synne against the holy ghost shall not be forgeuen, neither in this world nor in the world to come,</hi> whereof it appereth that some other synnes may be forgeuen in the worlde to come.</p>
                  <p>Well, this satisfaction may notwithstanding be fulfilled more then one waye. For a man being once by the sacramēt
<pb facs="tcp:3928:264"/> of penaunce iustly recōciled to the mysticall body of Christ,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 118.</note> which is his church, wherein (as the prophete sayeth) a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man is made partaker of all that feare God and kepe his commaundements: we haue in that bande of peace such an vnitie of Spirite communicated to vs all, that the defect of one may be in spirituall causes supplied out of the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all others his felowe membres, according as the Apostle sayeth,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Beare ye one an others burdens.</hi> And because the head (which is Christ) is the chiefe membre of all, and farre more then all the rest, such influence is from him deriued through out his mysticall body, that euen his death may as well inwardly by charitie, as outwardly by an other waie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so be applied to vs for the pardoning of that temporall satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, which after the sacrament of penaunce is left vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuen. And that is by such authoritie, as Christ gaue to <hi>Peter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Math.</hi> 16.</note> saying: <hi>To the I will geue the keyes of the kingdom of heauen, and what soeuer thou bindest in earth, it shall be bounde also in heauen, and whatsoeuer thou loosest in earth, it shall be loosed also in heauen.</hi> Lo, whatsoeuer Peter looseth in earth, it shall be loosed in the sight of God. If therefore the Pope who succedeth Peter, do by iust cause loose not only the mortall sinne by the sacrament of penaunce, but also the bande of temporall paine, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth yet due to the synne: it is vndoubted, that such paine is loosed in the sight of God. The cause of loosing must be not only the will of the Pope (who is put in authoritie to build, and not to destroy, to dispense and not to lauish) but a reasonable change or recompence substituted in that behal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, such as apperteineth to the honour of God, or to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of soules: As mainteining warre and sighting against in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels for the defence of Christendō, recouery of the sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre of Christ, succouring widowes, orphans, or other poore
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:3928:264"/> persons, the building or mainteining of holy places, the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of prisons and Martyrs toumbes, or any like deuout and charitable dedes. Which whiles the faithfull Christian doth obediently performe (although otherwise the thing enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned be not great) he may obteine remission also of that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall satisfaction, which was left in penaunce vnremitted. This kinde of pardon S. Paul gaue to that notorious synner, who at Corinth had his fathers wife,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</note> and was for that fault separated from the church of God, to be afflicted temporally in his flesh. But when the Corinthians had informed S. Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le of his ernest and true repentaunce, and had shewed their owne fauour and good willes toward him: the Apostle an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth, <hi>VVhom ye forgeue ought,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.</note>
                     <hi>I also (forgeue) for I also in that I haue forgeuen, if I haue forgeuen ought: for your sakes in the person of Christ, I haue forgeuen it.</hi> Well, we are assured the Apostle speaketh of forgeuing such afflictious, as the partye was in by reason he was deleuered out of the defence of holy church to that state,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>In.</hi> 1. <hi>Co.</hi> 5. <hi>Hom.</hi> 15.</note> where the deuill as S. Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom vpon that place noteth, <hi>pro solutione peccatorum for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his synnes</hi> might vexe him, and wherein such persons being put to their penaunce vsed to remaine for a certain space of moneths or yeres, vntill their penaunce were done and expired. Now the reconciling of the man not yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing done due satisfaction before his ordinary time, is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. Which the Apostle sayeth, he doth geue in the person of Christ, as hauing auctoritie of him to do it, and for the Corinthians sakes, as who were able by their holy praiers and common sorowe (whereof the Apostle speaketh) to make recompence for that which lacked on the behalfe of his owne satisfaction. If this much do not satisfie any man, desyring to be fully resolued herein, let him resorte to the latin workes of that holy and lerned Bishop of Rochester.

All Christes religion which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, consisteth not in these thinges, neither by these be mēs consciences quieted. By these men be put in minde of those thinges, and moued to the same, whereby quietnes of conscience may be atteined. By certaine of these euill and
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:3928:268"/> impure sprites be dryuen awaye in dede. Which here by sundry auncient recordes and testimonies I would declare to be most true, were it not well ynough knowen by dayly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. What benefite Christen people haue obteined by the signe of the crosse, both against the deuill and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise: in a treatise of late set forth of the crosse, euery one that listeth to see, maye read. By what other holy thinges being with prayer of the church consecrated through the power of God, he is dryuen awaye, it is not vnknowen. But as for you, whereas neither bread, nor water, nor crosse, driueth you awaye, it semeth ye are worse to be coniured, then the deuill him selfe. Many of your sect catholike Princes haue founde so stubborne, as they could yet neuer ridde their countries of them, but by coniuration of fyre.</p>

                     <hi>be the orient colours and precious sauours of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian religion: these thinges doth God looke vpon, and accepteth them thankfully: these must come in place to be honored and put quite away the institutions of Christ and of his Apostles. And li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke as in times past when wicked king Ieroboam had taken from the people the right seruing of God, and brought them to worship gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den calues, least perchaunce they might afterwards chaunge their minde and slippe awaye, gettinge them againe to Ierusalem to the Temple of God there, hee exhorted them with a long tale to be sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast, saying thus vnto them: O Israell, these Calues be thy Gods. In this sorte commaunded your God you should worshippe him. For it shoulde be wearisome and troublous for you to take vpon you a iorney so farre of, and yearly to go vp to Ierusalem, there to serue and honour your God. Euen after the same sorte euery whit, when these men had once made the lawe of God of none effect through their owne traditions, fearing that the people should afterwarde o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their eyes and fall an other way, and shoulde som whence els see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke a surer meane of their saluation, Iesu, how often haue they cried out. This is the same worshippinge that pleaseth God, and whiche hee straitly requireth of vs, and wherwhith he will be tourned from his wrath, that by these thinges is cōserued the vnitie of the church, by these all sinnes clensed and consciences quieted: and who so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth from these, hath left vnto himselfe no hope of euerlasting saluation. For it were wearisome and troublous (saye they) for the
<pb facs="tcp:3928:269"/> people to resorte to Christ, to the Apostles, and to the auncient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and to obserue continually what their will and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should be. This ye may se, is to withdraw the people of God from the weake elements of the worlde, from the leauen of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bes and Pharisies, and from the traditions of men. It were reason no doubt that Christes commaundemētes and the Apostls were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued, that these their deuises might come in place. O iuste cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se I promise you, why that auncient and so longe alowed doctrine should be now abolished, and a newe forme of religion be brought into the Churche of God.</hi>

Now once againe because your stuffe is spent, and haue no other thing to saye: thereof it foloweth by the topikes of your rhetorike (for good logike we see none ye haue) that we haue broken Gods commaundementes, the

To let passe that you haue well near a hūdred times said, and proued neuer a once, take this for an answere to your <hi>where they saye,</hi> that such wicked changes in religion, as ye haue made, neither is it lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to make with a councell, nor without a councell, because they are against the substance of our religion founded and instituted by Christ.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Iupiter and Apollo whom the deceiued antiquitie ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured as Gods, in dede were Idols.<note place="margin">Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Into whom euill sprites ennemies of mankinde entered, and out of them gaue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to those that consulted them for thinges vncertaine. Their answeres sometimes were true, sometimes false. With both their intent was to deceiue men. Agesilaus hauing founde by experience of others, that either at sometimes it was not true, what so euer Iupiter had answered, or at lest very doubtfull and hard to vnderstand: he thought good, to be the better assured of that he demaunded, to heare also the answere of Apollo, who had speciall praise for oracles. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther herein did he so fondly, as you saye.</p>
                  <p>Now (if I maye haue leaue to compare holy thinges with prophane which you do without leaue) forasmuch as the scriptures wherein God speaketh vnto vs, be in sundry pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb facs="tcp:3928:287"/> not most open and plaine to humaine senses, and many by mistaking them be deceiued: were it not well done of you for the more suretie and better vnderstanding of that ye go about,<note place="margin">It is a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se waye to trye and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine by the rule of the Traditiō of the church. <hi>Iohan.</hi> 14.</note> I meane in matters concerning religion, to folowe the iudgement of the catholike church represented in generall councels? Yea we saye boldlye, that surer it is in pointes of faith to leane to the exposition of the fathers agreing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to folowe the tradition of the church: then to trust to your selues, or to the letter of the scriptures scanned only by your owne wittes. For the church is promised to be lead into all truth by the holy ghost. Ye can not saye any such promise hath ben made to your particular companie. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refor it were not fondly done, as ye saye, but wisely saye we, if ye tried and examined your doctrine, which ye pretend to be according vnto the scriptures, by the rule of ecclesiasticall tradition, which is the chiefe rule to trye euery doctrine by. Which rule is nowhere better to be sene, then in generall councels, where is both excellencie of all knowledge, and the assistance of the holy ghost the spirite of truth. Neither is this to seeke allowance of that which God doth at mans han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, nor confirmation of that he commaundeth, by humaine auctoritie, but to examine priuate censures by the censure of the holy ghost, and to submit priuate opinions to publike iudgement.</p>

                     <hi>VVhy I besech vou, except a councell will and commaunde, shall not truth be truth, or God be God? If Christ had ment to do so from the begining, as that he would preach or teach nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Bishops consent, but referre all his doctrine ouer to Annas and Caiphas, where should no we haue ben the Christian faith? Or who at any time should haue heard the gospell taught? Peter ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely, whom the Pope hath oftener in his mouth and more reuerent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vseth to speake of, then he doth of Iesu Christ, did bodly stand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the holy councell, saying, it is better to obey God, then men. And after Paul had once intierly embraced the Gospell, and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:3928:287"/> it not from men, nor by man, but by the only will of God, he did not take aduise therin of flesh and bloud; nor brought his case before his kinsemen and brethern, but went forthwith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Arabia to preach Gods diuine misteries, by Gods only aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</hi>

                  <p>If you occupie a flute no better,<note place="margin">Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> by my reade you shall geue ouer your piping and flouting. Truth is truth, and God is God, whether any councell will or nill. Mary as for the truth and for God, euery councell laufully assembled hath will: so against the truth and against God, it hath no nill. As God is of him selfe and by him selfe, and not of man or angels: so his euerlasting truth dependeth not of Councels. Yet as God hath reueled him selfe to his church, and by his church is set forth to the world: so to the church he hath commended the word of his truth, and geuen his spirit to vnderstand it, and in the church it is kept, and by the church it is declared. Wherein who so euer agreeth not with the church, but repyneth against the church, he strayeth from the truth, and holdeth of Antichrist.</p>
                  <p>To that you bring of Christ, Peter, and Paul, we saye, Christ is peerlesse, Peter agreed with the rest of the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and for good cause refused conference with the wicked synagog of the Iewes, who openly professed enemitie against the truth, neither was it right that he should heare them, but now rather that they should heare him and the Apostles. As for that you saye of Paul in your defence, your case is farre vnlike. When ye proue vnto vs, that ye are specially called as Paul was, and haue a speciall commission to preach against the doctrine of the church, as he had against the wicked Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, then a Gods name take no aduise of any man, but forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with preach and crye out so lowd as ye list, so that ye goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Arabia, as Paul did, or where els so euer ye will. For euery good man would be loth England should be troubled with

For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas your matters are (as ye ordinarily saye) euident by plaine scripture, and the word of God is readen of euery man (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out distinction and limitation) therefore ye do first of all playe as fond a part as king Agesilaus did, who receiuing an answere of mighty Iupiter, wold afterward bring the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before Apollo. Yea furthermore, ye do much more fondly then he, if when ye may heare God him selfe speake plainely to you in the most holy scriptures, ye would bring the whole cause to be tried by a councell. Thirdly, I can not but desdaine at your doinges, and saye with your own wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des vnto you: Why I besech you except a councell will and commaund, shall not truth be truth, and God be God? Fourthly, I alleage after your maner the example of Christ him selfe, who preached without the bishops consent, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred not his doctrine ouer to Annas and Caiphas. Fifthly, I put you in remembraunce of Peter, which boldly stode against the holy councell. Sixthly, to conclude I saye that Paul, after he had once entierly embraced the Gospell, he did not take aduise therein of flesh and bloud,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Galat.</hi> 1.</note> nor brought the case before his kinsmen and brethren.</p>
                  <p>How saye ye then nowe, are not these your owne proper reasons, as by the lineaments of them ye may see at the first, and do they which vse such maner of arguments, conclude
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:3928:288"/> any regard to be made of councels? For if against generall coūcels, which are furthered with the wisedome, experience, authoritie, power, and prayer of the best and the most in all christendome are disgraced, withstanded, condemned by your foresaid worshipfull reasons: what estimatiō can ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to be geuen to assemblies and conferences of prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall councels? Therefore either ye greatly belye your sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, in making a wise as though ye despised not councels, against which ye argue so lustely, or els ye do wickedly to geue by your argumentes occasion to your readers, to con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>demne the assemblies and conferences of bishops out of all christendome, your selues in the meane while most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly beleuing it, that councels are not to be despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
                  <p>But go to now notwithstanding your examples, which do all make to the contrarie. How proue ye that ye despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se not councells? Mary by your owne fact and example, saying that ye haue not done that which ye haue done alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without bishops, or without a councell. Surely won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it was, that ye remembred not then king Agesilaus, Christ, S. Peter, S. Paul, besides other examples, which folow hereafter in this your Apologie, and vpon the sight of them departed frō the assemblie and councell, to which your bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops (as ye call them) and lerned men resorted. But your heads were occupied with other matters, and it semed worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while to do that which ye would do not altogether without bishops and councell.</p>
                  <p>Be it so then. Where haue ye treated of your matters? <hi>That matter hath ben treated</hi> (saye ye) <hi>in open parlament, with long consultation, and before a notable Synode and conuocation.</hi> First in what parlament? Meane ye the first of our soueraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne lady Quene Elizabeth, or any of those of king Edward
<pb facs="tcp:3928:289"/> the 6. his dayes? If ye meane any of those so long ago passed, such as afterward in his sister Quene Maryes time were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed,<note place="margin">The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders argument or parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in defence of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, no lesse then of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers.</note> although ye made no lye at all, in saying your matters to haue ben treated then in opē parlamēt, and with long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultatiō: yet except ye proued them to be allowed also by full parlament, ye should neuer haue made mention of them, specially whereas the parlaments in Quene Maryes dayes with as due consultation and full assent of all states and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees condemned your predecessours doinges, as euer they were by any fauour cōmended, that was shewed in the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge princes nonage. But if ye meane (as by reason ye must) the parlamentes of these later dayes, the first of al did make most for you, and yet how open was it for you? Had ye any place at all in it? Were ye admitted within the dores? Or had ye any thing to do in that assemblie? Consider then with what consultation your purposes were concluded. Did they tarie many monethes about it? Had they bishops? Had they diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and the most lerned, to reason to and fro with all libertie? Was the authoritie of the vniuersall church of Christ and the doctrine of the auncient fathers considered? Ye saye in latine <hi>plenis comitijs,</hi> that is in the full and whole assemblie, as though none at all had there resisted, but euery man had yelded to your matters. What saye ye then of the spirituall lordes a great part of the parlament, and without all doubt the part which must be chiefly and only regarded when the question is of religion? How many of them gaue their voice to your gospel? Yea which of thē al did not resist it? One alone, I must confesse, was afterward made to breake vnitie, of whom a right good and catholike bishop said, to a noble man, we had but one foole among vs, and him ye haue gotten vnto you. But as of the spirituall Lordes ye had none at all, (except that one litle worthy of the name of a
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:3928:289"/> bishop and lord whose lerning was small and honour ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by much steyned) so of the temporall ye had not all, and so had ye also in the lower house very many and well lerned, that spake against you. And mo woulde, had conscience ben as free, as auctoritie was dredfull. And yet, call ye this a full parlament, and a parlament which had all his partes wholy fauoring you?</p>
                  <p>But let vs consider the notable conuocation in which your matter hath ben treated.<note place="margin">Of the gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation.</note> If ye meane the clergie comming together at that first parlament time of which we speake, it was of catholikes not of sacramentaries, and it put vp a bill against your procedinges, so farre it was of from confirming them. If ye meane any since that time in which your superintendentships mette together, for what cause was it a notable synode, and a notable conuocation? Or with what possibilitie of consultation may we thincke, that ye did treat there of your matters, which were first concluded, against the catholike bishops willes, and without any voice of yours, before ye came to your consultation? Marke I praye you well, these two times. When ye did first in this our Quenes time breake into the realme, in the parlament forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ensuing, the Pope was renounced, your cause was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred. But how? Against the will and sentences of the bishops and lerned men, and against the expresse instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and intimations of the conuocation then gathered. And therefore ye can not crake, concerning that time, of your long consultation and full parlament, by which your matter should seme to be commended. It folowed then afterward, that catholike bishops were imprisoned, and ye placed in their churches. And then in dede, when all went with you, a parlament was holden, and a conuocatiō also of ministers. But is this that notable conuocation, without which ye did
<pb facs="tcp:3928:290"/> not that which ye do? How sensible and folish a lye is this, to report as though ye had not proceded in your mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, without long consultation, wheras your purposes were by other wayes concluded for you, before ye had any power to make a conuocation? Yet these absurdities and obiections notwithstanding, ye dare to speake of full parlament, long consultation, notable Synode, as who should thinke, that it were no maruell, why your gospel hath ben receiued, because forsooth, all thinges were examined to the vttermost, in full parlament and a notable conuocation. Which if it were true in dede, it might iustly moue a simple and vnlerned mā, to see a whole realme in a full parlament, aduisedly to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine any matter. And this being most auailable to win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of credite, and yet in the very dede it selfe, lest able to be proued, ye be desperate in your lying, and crake of a full par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament and a notable synode, not regarding by what meanes ye promote your cause to the multitude, and saue your sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues from reproch of extreme folie. For otherwise ye which can so amplifie the small and obscure meetinges of a fewe Caluinistes of one litle Iland, what would ye not saye of the last generall councell, to which more nations were as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled together,<note place="margin">The gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atnes of the last generall councell of Trent.</note> then are shyres in England, more yeres were bestowed in consultation, then weekes in your full par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament, more bishops defined and subscribed, then were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of all sortes in your notable Synode by many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</p>
                  <p>I haue taried the longer about this point (gentle reader) because it is much worth to be considered quietly. first how shamefully and notably these men trotte forth in lying, then how gorgiously and solemnely they can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their owne conuocations, and last of all how iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and contemptuously they dare speake of the generall
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:3928:290"/> councell. An other thing yet more is to be considered,<note place="margin">The super indentes children not yet made le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g t mate by parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> that all their doinges are so well allowed in full parlament, that to this daye it can not be obteined, that their superintendents and ministers children so many as haue taken holy orders, should be legitimate. Lastly if they will nedes haue their matters seme to depend of their parlament, let vs not be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, if we call it parlament religion, parlament gospell, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament faith.<note place="margin">Parlamēt faith.</note> Yet shall ye geue vs leaue, who feare to lose our soules, to beleue that we haue receiued of olde from Christ and his Apostles by continuall successions of laufull bishops.

For it is a common custome of theirs, often and shameleslye to boast that their Churche cannot er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, that in it there is no faulte, and that they muste giue place to vs in nothynge. Or yf there be anye faulte, yet must it be tried by Bisshoppes and Abbottes, only bycause they be the directers and Rulers of matters, and they be the Church of God. Aristotle saith, that a Citie cannot consist of Bastardes: but whether the Church of God may consiste of these men, let their owne selues consider.

                     <hi>VVhen many bishops in the first daye of September were assembled together at Carthage out of the prouince of Aphrike, Numidia, Maurita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, with their priestes and Deacons, the most part of the people also being present, after that the letters of Iubaianus written to Cyprian and of Cyprian to Iubaianus againe had ben readen, concerning heretikes to be baptized: and what after that the same Iubaianus wrote againe to Cyprian:</hi> (all this done) <hi>Cyprian said. &amp;c.</hi> These be the wordes in the actes of that prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall synode put before the sentences of the bishops.</p>
                  <p>Now what can you gather out of them for your purpose more, but that a great number of the people were present only in the church or other place, where the bishops were assembled? That certaine of the common people were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to this councell, there is no such worde mencioned nor by Cyprian, nor by any els. Neither were the priestes them selues (which this youthfull gentilwoman interpreteth el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders) and Deacons called thither, but they attended vpon the bishops, as in such case it hath ben accustomed, for sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence none might geue in a councell, but only bishops. Then how much lesse were the common people called to that councell, specially to sitte as iudges in ecclesiasticall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? Though the english interpretation nameth it acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, yet the latine hath the terme of iudging, and therfore I slaūder you not. Of the presence of the people you cā not make argument, that they were thereby made iudges. Who seeth not how boldly the people putteth thē selues in presse where so euer any such solemne assemblie or meeting is? Yea almost who can kepe them from comming in place where any publike notable act is done? Because they will be present only to heare and gase, shal we say, they be called the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reto, and made iudges or chiefe doers? Shall we saye, that the
<pb facs="tcp:3928:293"/> people which is cōmonly sene in Westminster hall at a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, be iudges of matters pleaded there, because they be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent? At the first conuocation in Quene Maries time, when certaine catholikes and your brethrē reasoned together about pointes of religion, the people in great nūber at Paules were present. Likewise at the disputatiō holden at Oxford betwen certaine catholike Doctours and Cranmare, Latimer, and Ridley, no small nūber of the people both of the towne and the countrie there about were also present. So was it in the first yere of the Quenes maiesties raigne, when disputation was gone about to be kept at Westminster. If this be chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicled, as I thinke it shalbe, shall the posteritie hereof argue, that the common people were called to be iudges in syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, in cōuocations, in publike disputatiōs of matters pertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to religion? Of such causes their only presence maketh them iudges no more, then it maketh them bishops. Mary that you would so haue it, I thinke well. For such confusion might best serue you to procure the ouerthrowe of good order, in which the church is gouerned. which if it be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined duly, your disordered and rebellious state will sone be confounded.</p>
                  <p>As for laye men, truth it is, in due order, they are admitted to councels. And all Catholike princes had their Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours in this late councell at Trēt.

For the fathers of the councell do helpe the faith and doctrine of the highest pastour.

For Gods prouidence so tendereth the church, that the chiefe members, though they depend of the head, yet defend and helpe the head.</p>
                  <p>Againe, the councell maketh the people better willing to receiue the faith, by reason of the most acceptable witnesses and iudgementes of a great meany. For we see the lawes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, made, and enacted by aduise of the nobilitie and chiefe states of a common weale, to be better accepted of the people, then if they were set forth by proclamation of the Prince only. Wherefore Beda admonisheth discretly,<note place="margin">Lib. retra. in act. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolorū.</note> that Paul conferred the gospell which he had preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest the gentiles, with the other Apostles, seeking ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be resolued, whether he preached rightly of the ceassing of the obseruances of the lawe.

<pb facs="tcp:3928:295"/> Apostolike councell.</p>
                  <p>To that you alleage secondly as a great inconuenience, we tell you, that forasmuch as the Pope is at euery generall councell laufully assembled either in person, as sundry Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes haue ben, or by his legates: neither it is an vnlaufull dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,<note place="margin">Matters debated in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels be reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Pope for finall cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatiō.</note> nor such tossing as you terme it, matters maturely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated in the councell, to be referred to the Pope head of the councell, not so much for a newe triall, as for finall confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. The fathers of the Nicene councell besought S. Syluester, that what they had ordeined, he would confirme and ratifie. And Leo what thinges the councell of Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don had decreed touching matters of faith, sayeth, that he approueth them. And the councel it selfe speaking to Leo sayeth thus. <hi>Decretis tuis nostrum honora iudicium.

Either you haue readen the place of Hosius, or you haue not. If you haue not, then are you to blame to saye so much euill, that you knowe not. If you haue readen the place, then is your fault plaine malice in putting that to Hosius, the contrary where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you finde in the place by your selfe alleaged, by which you leade vs as it were by the hande to beholde and consider your owne dishonestie. Chose of these two faultes, with which you had rather to be burthened. For the one han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth on you, and you shall neuer honestly shake it of. How iust cause you haue to reprehēde Hosius, for that he wrote against Brentius in defence of Petrus a Soto touching the councell in which Christ was condemned by Caiphas, it should best appere to him, that would read the whole place, where Hosius treateth that matter. The same would I here haue rehersed to the discouering of your false dealing and
<pb facs="tcp:3928:301"/> shameles lying, were not the same very long, and this booke now riseth to a greater quantitie, thē my purpose was at the beginning it should. Wherefore referring the lerned reader to the place in the second booke against Brentius, these fewe I saye here in defence both of Peter a Soto, and specially of Hosius.<note place="margin">Hosius defended against the slaunder of the defender.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, this is the truth touching the whole. The actes of those priestes of the Iewes synagog were wicked and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Christ. But their sentence, though them selues were neuer so euill, was not only true, but also to mankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de most profitable. And S. Iohn in his gospell witnesseth, it was the oracle of God. For when after long deliberation of the councell, Caiphas the high bishop and president of that councell, had pronounced his sentence, whereunto all the rest almost gaue their consent, <hi>it is expedient for vs that one man dye for the people,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioan.</hi> 19.</note>
                     <hi>and not that all the nation perish:</hi> the euangeliste thereto added his verdite saying, <hi>this he said not of him selfe, but whereas he was high bishop of that yere, he prophecied.</hi> Therefore let this be the true conclusion of the whole matter. The actes of that councell were wicked, the sentence was true and good. Now Hosius treateth this matter so lernedly and so substātially, as you cā not truly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke any aduātage of his wordes to reprehend him. He stayeth him selfe vpon the scripture, a good ground to stand vpon. Which scripture referreth doubtfull and hard questions to the priestes of the Leuiticall order. Of whom it is said, <hi>Indicabunt tibi iudicij veritatem.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deu.</hi> 17.</note>
                     <hi>They shall shewe vnto thee the truth of iudgement.</hi> In this iudgement sayeth Hosius, though it were neuer so wicked, yet was the truth of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. How that might be, there he proueth it to Brentius by most manifest argumentes. And concludeth that foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as by testimonie of the Gospell, Caiphas, for that he
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:3928:301"/> was the hgih bishop of that yere, prophecied: that the Leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall priesthod lacked not the spirite of prophecie, the holy ghost, the spirite of truth, vntill the time in which Christ offered him selfe a bloudy sacrifice to God the father, and so gaue ende vnto that priesthod and sacrifice. Their saying, <hi>VVe haue a lawe, and according to this lawe he ought to die,</hi> was a true worde, as Hosius declareth. For in dede it was the lawe of God the father, which the sonne by his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord tooke vpon him, and submitted him selfe thereto, to dye for our synnes. Which lawe by the decree of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked bishops was fulfilled, when Christ was crucified, which Christ him selfe signified, by that he spake at the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vp of his ghost on the crosse, <hi>Consummatum est,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioan.</hi> 19.</note>
                     <hi>it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where ye impute to Hosius to haue said, that the same plainely was a iuste decree, whereby they pronounced that Christ was worthy to dye, that is your slaunderous lye, not Hosius saying. For he sayeth the cleane contrarye, and that sundry times, that it was a wicked councell, and most vniuste decree. God forbidde any christen man should saie, that Christ was worthy to die. He saith, it might haue ben truly pronounced by Caiphas, that he was gilty of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ath. And there he sheweth how, very religiously and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admonishing the reader, that he was most innocent, and deserued not to dye. And thus Syr you may see, we take not part with Annas and Caiphas as you raile, and yet be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble God be thanked, to defend our true cause, and declare you to the world to be false teachers. Therefore belye vs no more. We call not that a laufull and a good councell, but contrariwise most wrongful and wicked. If you conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newe in lying, thinke that it will be retourned ouer vpon you to your owne shame. Verely such dealing maketh
<pb facs="tcp:3928:302"/> argument of the weakenes of your part, and of your wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked impudencie. If your bokes be thus suffered to go abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad, and your selues to preach, what maruell is it, if the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be deceiued? Our lord looke mercifully vpon them, and deliuer them from such deceiuers, who put their hope and trust altogether in lying.</p>

The first sixe moneth, as though it were greatly nedefull, they made many determinations of the holy Trinitie, of the Father, of the Son, and the holy Ghost, which were godly thinges in deede, but not so necessarye for that time. Let vs see in all that while of so many, so manifest, so often confessed by them and so euident errours, what one errour haue they amended? from what kinde of idolatrie haue they reclaimed the people?

That the first six monethes they occupied them selfes with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king many determidatiōs of the holy Trinitie, that also is an other lye. For then the world had no nede of any newe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations or decrees concerning the Trinitie, what it shall haue hereafter by occasion of your chief Maister Iohn Caluines doctrine, it is more feared then yet perceiued.

Iuelles chalenge at their first comming abrode. That done to cast brutes abrode, that the Apologie was made and counterfeited by some crafty Papist, to bring you quite out of credite with all the world. So might ye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb facs="tcp:3928:307"/> in time recouer some part of your lost estimation. For whiles your bookes be in mens handes, they shalbe an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent witnes to all the world of your shameles lying. We nede not to proclaime you lyers, your owne publike writing maketh proclamation of it euery where. Ye alleage six causes why ye came not to the councell. The first is because (as ye pretend) ye be not suffered so much as to sytte or once to be sene in our meetinges,<note place="margin">Syx cause alleaged by the defenders, why they came not to the late generall Councel.</note> much lesse to spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke freely your mynde, and that the auncient and christian libertie, which of all right should specially be in christian co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uncels, is now vtterly taken a waye from the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. How true this is all Christendome knoweth, and your selues can not be ignorant. The booke of the canons and decrees of the councell hath ben printed almost in all partes of Christendome.<note place="margin">Safecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductes graunted forth for gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe coming to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uncell at Tren e.</note> Loke who liste, in euery booke he shall finde three seuerall solemne safeconductes graunted by the councel, and cōfirmed by the three Popes, vnder whom the same was celebrated. Which safeconductes conteine first in most ample wise full libertie, power, auctoritie and assurance for all and singuler persons of all Germanie, of what degree, state, condition or qualitie so euer they be, that would come to that oecumenical and general coūcel, to cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre propoūd, and treate with al freedom, of al thinges to be treated there, and to the same councell freely and safely to come, there to tarry and abide, and to offer and put vp ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, so many as they thought good, as well in writing as by word, and with the fathers and others thereto chosen, to conferre, and without any reproches or vpbraidinges to dispute, also at their pleasure safely againe frō thēs to depart.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore in the forsaid safeconductes the Protestan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes are permitted for their more libertie and securitie, that if for offences by them committed or to be committed they
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:3928:307"/> were desirous to haue iudges deputed to them, they should name such as bare them good will, yea though their offences were neuer so haynous and sauering of heresie.</p>
                  <p>This is the abridgement of either of those three safecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutes. The first so graunted and confirmed by Pope Paul the third, is put in the booke of the councell after the xiij. Session. The second so graunted and confirmed by Pope Iulius the third, is set after the xv. Session. The third is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced after the xviij. Session. Which was graunted likewise by the countcell, and confirmed by our holy father the Pope Pius the fourth yet lyuing. After which immediatly folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth an extension of the same libertie, securitie, faith publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, and safeconduct, to other nations. The same because it is short, hauing relation to the safeconduct before expressed, which is very lōg: I wil not let here to put in truly trāslated.</p>
                  <p>An extension to other nations.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>This being most true, as the better part of the world seeth, and the bookes and publike instrumtēes extant do witnesse: your excuse of your refusal to come to the coūcell, as bishops of other christiā Realmes did, is founde false. Ye had al free li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie and securitie graunted vnto you for that behalfe in so ample and large maner, as mans witte could deuise. And if your selues would haue penned the instrument of the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cōducte to your one most cōmoditie, all your heads could not haue deuised how to haue made it more free and sure for you (onlesse ye would haue had your heresies being once perfitly confuted to be allowed for truth) then it was. Thus is your first cause fully answered, and cleane wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped awaye.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin" type="runSum">2</note>The second cause why ye came not, is, for that the Popes legates,<note place="margin">The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of the fathers concord at the Tridenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</note> Patriarches, Archebishops, Bishops, and Abbottes, all being conspired together, all lincked together in one kinde of fault, and all bounde in one oth, sit alone by them selues, and haue power alone to geue their consent. What is here that should let you to ioyne with others for procuring vnitie and peace in Christendom? Complaine ye of the fathers concord and agreeing together? That is a signe the spirite of God auctour of charitie and vnitie gouerneth their hartes. In that respect they seme to come together in the holy ghost. For what els you meane by your terme of conspiring and lincking together in one fault,<note place="margin">The vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to heretikes a conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie.</note> I knowe not. Ye had rather they were diuided I suppose, and that were more to your purpose. In dede their ioyning together in defence of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:3928:308"/> faith, semeth to you a fault and a conspiracie. For to you it is a most damnable fault, a man to be a Papist, that is so saye, catholike. And who so euer ioyne together in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith, the same seme to you to conspire against you. So true and trustie subiectes conspire against rebelles. So the iudges, iustices, and the twelue men at the assises conspire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst felones.</p>
                  <p>And what saye ye here for flying conference in the late councell, where ye were summoned, called, and required to come, and to saye for your selues what ye could, that rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, traitours, theues, murtherers, and such the like might not saye for their not appering in iudgement? With as good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as ye saye here, they may saye also. What madnes were it for vs to come to the Assises or Sessions? The Iudges, the Iustices, the Lawyers, the whole bench, the twelue men, be they not all conspired together? Be they not all lincked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one fault of riddyng vs out of the waye? Be not they bound by one oth to serue the Quene truly? Haue not they only the handling of our matter in their owne handes? Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue not they power to geue verdite and sentence against vs? Wherefore we were worse then madde to come there, if we maye kepe our selues awaye. The tale ye tell here for your selues, is none other. And in dede had ye gone thither, your heresies had ben confuted, your selues required to yelde, and to conforme you to the catholike church, or els ye had ben anathematized, accursed, and condemned. Now, because ye thought ye should do no good there, that is to saye, ye should not be able to mainteine your newe gospell, ye thought bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to tarry at home. For my part in good sooth I would not blame you, were it so for suretie, that after this good chere ye make here with your brethren and systers in Christ, a hard reckening were not to be made, where if ye repent not, ye
<pb facs="tcp:3928:309"/> are most assured to paye and laye downe your myserable soules to the euerlasting torment of hell fyre.</p>
                  <p>But ye complaine, the Legates, Patriarkes, archebishops, &amp;c. sitte alone by them selues, and haue power alone to geue consent. What would ye laye men to haue gone thither and sit among the Bishops? Would ye haue swordes and buckelers, rapiers and buskines, come into a generall Councell, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue sentēce in matters of faith?<note place="margin">Laie men be not wholly excluded from councels.</note> Not so. Yet laye mē be not who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excluded. For there be the Ambassadours of all Princes and states. But sentence they geue not, that perteineth to Bishops only. Doubtles if M. Doctor Parker, and M. Yong had bē Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chebishops, and gone thither, they should haue had their sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes amongest the Archebishops there. Lykewise if ye had had any bishops in your clergy, comming thither they had ben placed among the bishops. Mary their wiues I thinke should not haue ben suffered to sit amongest them. Therefore to kepe them companie they had rather tarry at home. Thus is your second cause refelled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin" type="runSum">3</note>Your third cause is, for that the determinations and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the councell be referred to the Pope. To that we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue answered before. The Pope confirmeth all, being head o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the councell. Doth not the Quene so pardy confirme your actes of parlament, by geuing her Roiall assent vnto them at thend of the parlament? What thing can be done perfitly by a body without the head? And who might better confirme councels, then he, whose faith in pronouncing sentence rightly and duly in matters concerning faith, we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re assured by Christes prayer,<note place="margin">

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin" type="runSum">4</note>Your fourth cause is, forasmuch as the auncient and Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian libertie, which of right should specially be in Christian Councels, is now vtterly taken away. This cause is not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from your first. Your repetition is voide and vaine.
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:3928:309"/> One answer maye serue both. That ye pretend in both is false, as I haue now proued.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin" type="runSum">5</note>Your fifth cause is a false lye, that Princes Ambassadours be vsed but as mocking stockes. Truth it is,<note place="margin">Princes Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doures be honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall councels.</note> they haue most honorable seates in all councels.

And that altogether by an auncient or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance in that behalfe made and agreed vpon of olde time, for auoyding of stryfe and emulation. Which all men maye see set forth in print.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin" type="runSum">6</note>The sixth and last cause, ye alleage for your not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the councell is, for that ye be condemned already before triall, as though the matter were a forehand dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and agreed vpon. In dede your heresies for the more part be and haue ben condemned aboue a thousand yeres past. And therefore they are not now to be called vnto a newe triall,<note place="margin">The go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spellers heresies nede not a newe discussiō. Iohn. 14.</note> as though the church vntill this daye had ben deceiued, and so many fathers ouersene. If the holy ghost haue hitherto taught the church, and derected it vnto all truth, according to Christes promise, they should do iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the holy ghost, who would bring your doctrine, that so euidently appereth contrary to the catholike faith, to be tried by a newe discussion. And yet to thintent ye might be conuerted and made good christian men, had ye come thither, ye had ben heard to saye what ye could, your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes had ben clearly discussed, and the truth playnely set forth before you. For who knoweth whether God will open your hartes, and geue you grace to repent? This notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing may ye well saye touching that point, your matter is afore hand dispatched and agreed vpon. For they knowe
<pb facs="tcp:3928:310"/> what ye can saye, and see, that ye saye nothing, but only stand wilfully and stubbornly in your false opinions, and fleshly pleasures. This the world seeth and considereth, that ye can not alleage somuch as one iust and reasonable cause, why ye would not come to the generall Councell.</p>

But the reason which to this ende ye make, is so slender, as I wene fewe Princes that feare God, wilbe greatly moued to aduenter that thing so much subiect and thrall to Gods reuenge. In effecte your reason is this, cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syder it who will. They of the clergy be no other but ciuill Princes, ergo temporall Princes maye beare the office of bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops. Syr both your argument is naught, and your antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is false.

                  <p>Though the Pope haue a princely dominion, and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bishops of Christendome haue dukedomes and Erledo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, though they ryde well accompanied with men and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, yea though some of them otherwise then becommeth that vocation, do weare cheynes and colers of gold, as you belye them: though they haue other ornamentes to their states per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining, which griueth you much in comparison of the beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery of your maried estate: yet all this imbarreth them not but that they be Bishops. As in your worthy clergie an honest so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber tapster, that can read in the communion booke, may be a minister of the congregation, although he weare a square cappe, be it neuer so great a disorder in your conceite: so these landes, traines, rich ornamentes and fournitures take not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye from bishops, but for all that they be bishops.</p>
                  <p>Though they teach not, though they saye not, though they do not, though they lyue not, as becommeth bishops, neither as becommeth euen a Christen man, as you raile, all

<pb facs="tcp:3928:313"/> and not secular Princes.<note place="margin">The sum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me of this chap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter cōfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> Now to geue a colour hereto, and to moue Princes to take the matter into their owne handes, they saye as becommeth them and none els. For there is no man of wisdome or honestie, that would with so impudent lyes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish his credite, and with so immoderate vpbraidinges im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire the estimation of his modestie. Neither be these men so hote in this matter for any loue they beare to secular Princes. For if any such Prince be not a fauorer of their gospell, then haue they a blast of a trompet to blow him downe, as it appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by their bookes made against the monstrous regiment of women, and by the good obedience their French brethren the Huguenots kepe toward their king in Fraunce. Other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the like Euangelicall obedience in other countries, I leaue to mens remembrance. If a cardinall, be he of neuer so euill life, defend their preaching, he is an honest man I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you, and of a good iudgement, and worthy of that ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. Thus they measure all thinges by phansie, not by truth.</p>
                  <p>But now let vs see what complaint they make both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst bishops, and in the behalfe of ciuill magistrates. <hi>Bishops</hi> saye they, <hi>neither knowe nor will knowe the matters of religion, nor yet set a iote by any point thereof, saue that which belongeth to the kitchin and to the bellye,</hi> for so hath the latine. <hi>And they be no better ouerseers of the watche tower, then blinde spies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These wordes being thus spoken in generall of all, be odious in respect of men, and blasphemous against Christ. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be bishops generally so ignorant, so negligent, so voide of religion, so geuen to the bellye, so blinde: nor Christ so vnmyndfull to assist them with grace, whom he hath mad his commissioners.<note place="margin">

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:3928:313"/> creatures power and meanes to encrease and multiplie. Were it not so, Christ should haue failed his church in necessaries, and haue laid awaye his prouidence and care of the church, which to saye is blasphemous.</p>
                  <p>Touching the reproch of the kitchin and the bellye, in what countrie vtter these lyers this kinde of slaunder? Had they any sparke of shame in them, they would not speake this in England, where catholike bishops be founde so farre from kitchin and bellye matters, as the newe superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes there are nigh to them. Who setteth more by his bellye, he that often times fasteth, and by abstinence from meates and drinkes punisheth his belly for Christes sake, the better to subdue the rebellion of his lustes, and to make his flesh obedient to the spirite: or he that eateth and drinketh alwayes of the best, to the intent he maye serue the lustes of his strumpet at her commaundement, without whom most of our newe gospellers can no more lyue, as them selues saie, then a fish without water, or as Luther said, then a man can liue without spitting? If they meane not of english bishops, but of others, let them go and possesse their places, whose lyues they reprehend: what do they nowe in England in their chayres,<note place="margin">VVhat bishops be most ready to receiue this new gospell.</note> the shadowe of whose vertues they can not folowe? This I will boldly say, in what so euer countrie Bishops lyue worst, euery of them as he vseth him selfe most licenciously for his belly and the thinges that be vnder his belly, so much the more forewarde he is to receiue this newe gospell. And most of them all of that sorte, were it not for some indirect regard which they haue to their honor and richesse vnder a catholike prince, would soner become here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, then remaine Papistes.</p>
                  <p>Let any man of reason iudge, whether he that maketh his belly his God, would not holde with that gospell which
<pb facs="tcp:3928:314"/> mainteineth only faith to iustifie, the keping of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes to be impossible, confession of synnes not to be necessarie, a stedfast trust in Christes passion to be the only sufficient waye to saue al men, lyue they neuer so loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and disorderly: rather then with the gospell, which prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth no saluation to be without keping the whole lawe (so farre as man may kepe it), or rising againe from synne by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, that only faith to iustifie which worketh by chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that all mortall synnes vnder paine of damnation must be confessed to the priest if occasion suffer, that Christes passion is applyed by meanes of the sacramentes vnto vs, and not by confidence of our owne phansies. What synne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man I saye, all thinges being equal, would not rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue and folowe this newe wrested kinde of gospel, then the olde interpretation thereof? Where any secular Prince in any realme hath consented to change religion, doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience euidently shewe, that bishops, abbottes, priestes, monkes, friers of loose lyfe forthtwith embraced this newe gospel, and those only withstod it, who were chaste and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous? Therefore we cōfesse some fewe euil bishops to be in other countries, but they are the shame of your gospell Sirs, whereunto they belong. And they in dede set not a iote by any point of religiō, but only by their belly and fleshly lustes.</p>
                  <p>Now where as ye finde fault, that princes be executours of bishops decrees, and be not iudges, nor geue sentence therof them selues: ye must vnderstand, that Princes will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so at an other time make a lawe of temporall matters, as of paying tributes,<note place="margin">The offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a priest and a Prince be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct.</note> of warre, of peace, whereof sometime the bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop shal be in some parte executour, and yet not the iudge. The offices of a priest and a prince be so much distincted, as the state of the church differeth from a prophane com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale. In the church he is head, whom Christ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:3928:314"/> shepeherd ouer his flocke. In a common weale, he is head, who hath right to it by inheritance, or whom the people maketh ruler. If the matter decreed be spirituall and apperteining to faith, the prince ought to obeie without question or grudge. If it be a temporall decree, the bishop who hath temporall goodes vnder the prince, must likewise obeie without grudge or gainesayng. So shall that which belongeth to God, be geuen to God,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luc.</hi> 2.</note> and that which belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to Caesar, shalbe geuen to Caesar.</p>
                  <p>Neither can a christian bishop commaund any prince to destroie religion, and to crucifie Christ him selfe againe, for then he leaueth to be a Christian, and becommeth an infidell, whose decree a prince ought not to be obey.</p>
                  <p>Ye set Annas and Caiphas, to Dauid and Ezechias, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se lyues, offices, and merites, were farre different. Would God we had many Dauids, and Ezechiases. I knowe not where ye can iustly crake of them. As for Annas and Caiphas, they were bishops, after that euill kinde of bishops (touching merite of life) who now are called superintendētes. For they forsooke the true spirite and harte of the lawe, as our newe superintendētes altogether folowing the flesh haue forsaken the spirite and hart of the gospell, only pretending a name and colour of it without any truth or honestie.</p>
                  <p>And yet concerning the office of bishops, Annas and Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas came to it not fully by so euill meanes, as our superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendentes came to their office. They kept yet the traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and order of the lawe in outward thinges. They suffered the temple and aulter to stande. Sacrifice was done to God. But these superintendentes haue throwen downe aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters euery where, the temples of Christ in many places, and denye the thankefull sacrifice to God, which is the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud of his dere sonne. If therefore they bid
<pb facs="tcp:3928:315"/> Christ to be throwen out of the church, his blessed body to be troden vnder feete, no Prince ought to heare them.</p>
                  <p>Now Dauid and Ezechias were they neuer so good men, yet their office was not priesthod, as it shall appere hereafter. If a Cardinal being a mā of warre, and delighting in bloud (as these men saye) sit in the councell, he increaceth his ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne damnation, by handling holy matters with synnefull handes. But that excuseth not a temporall Prince requiring to haue the place of a iudge there. But if any Christiā prince without auctoritie of iudging will sit in the councell, it is not denyed to him. Yea all Christian Princes, as we haue said before,<note place="margin">A Prince may sit in a genreall councell without auctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging.</note> haue their place assigned them in a generall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uncell, and their oratours and ambassadours haue it in their absence. And had not certaine gospellers geuen contrary aduise, we had sene at the late councell of Trent the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassours also of our soueraine lady Quene Elizabeth, with those of other christian princes. But they that sought diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, (which is not the best waye to procure safetie) diswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her Maiestie from that matter.</p>

                     <hi>For besydes that a Christian Prince hath the charge of both ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles committed to him by God,<note place="margin">Apologie</note> to the ende he maye vnderstande that not temporall matters only, but also religious and ecclesiastical causes perteyne to his office:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You will proue that ecclesiasticall causes perteine to a kinges office, because he hath the charge of both tables.<note place="margin">Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> If you meane that a king is bound to kepe bothe tables of the lawe, so is also euery priuat man. And yet as no priuat man is supreme head of the church by keping them, so neither the king is proued thereby the supreme head. If you mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne that the king ought to see others to kepe both tables of the lawe: that maye he do either in appointing temporall paines for the transgressours of them, or in executing the
<pb facs="tcp:3928:316"/> said paines vpon the transgressours. But as he can not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate any man for not appering when he is called, so can he not iudge all causes of the lawe. For if a man syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne only in his harte, as for example in murder, or aduoutrie: the king can not haue to do with him. And yet the true supreme head of the church shall haue to do with him. For that malicious and sinfull thought shall neuer be forgeuen, except the party come to be absolued of their successours, to whom Christ said,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>whose synnes ye forgeue, they are forgeuen, and whose synnes ye reteine, they are reteined.</hi> To committe murder in harte is a synne, and it is reteined vntill it be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuen.

Which he can not knowe, vntill it be confessed with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite hart by him who only knoweth it, and is bound to tell it for absolutions sake. If then there be a iudge, who can see the lawe kept in an higher pointe and beyond the reach of the king, surely the king shall not be supreme head, sith an other is more like to God, then he. As who is iudge of the inward conscience, whereunto no king rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, but only the minister of Christ, who is the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall king,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Besides also that God by his Prophetes often and earnestly commaundeth the king to cut downe the groues, to breake dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne the Images and aultres of Idoles, and to write out the bookes of the lawe for him selfe: and besides that the Prophet Esaias saith, a king ought to be a patrone and nurse of the churche:</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note>Your second argument for the ecclesiasticall power of kinges is, because God bad them to cut downe superstitious groues, and ouerthrowe idols, as though this were not an office of executing a commaundement, rather then of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing any thing. The authoritie to discerne an image of
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:3928:316"/> Christ from an idoll of the deuill, belongeth to them who knowe that an image is a name of arte, which is of God, an idoll is a name of false worshipping, which is of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. So that an image is godly, and idoll deuilish. When the priest hath iudged this or that to be an idoll, or when it is euident, that so it is, then the king shall do well to breake it downe. But if the king will breake downe the image of Christ, when the priest telleth him it is a godly represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and no idol: then the king doth more then his office re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.

If the priestes must geue the holy scripture vnto the king, then verely must he take such as they geue him, and with such meaning as they geue vnto it.

                  <p>The putting of priestes and bishops in mynde of their dutie, is not a supremacie in determining ecclesiasticall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. And whereas you saye that king Ioas bridled the riot and arrogancie of the priestes, if it were so, it was well done. But I finde not those wordes in the text, Concerning that king Iehu did, it is a mere temporall office,<note place="margin">4. <hi>reg.</hi> 10.</note> to put false prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and heretikes to death. Neither can it belong to priestes, onlesse they haue also ciuill iurisdiction.

                  <head>THE TWELFTH CHAPTER.</head>
                  <p>It was a great tediousnes good reader aswell for thee to read,<note place="margin">Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion.</note> as for me to answere these vnsensible argumentes of our newe english clergy. One answere might haue serued to them all, but I thought it would be looked for, that I should saye somewhat to euery example.<note place="margin">Thoffice of a king cōsidered in it selfe' is one euery where.</note> Now I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this matter, doing thee to vnderstand, that if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the office of a king in it selfe, it is one euery where, not only among christen princes, but also amōg hethē. The defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of a king which agreeth to Iulius Cesar, or to Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander the great, as they were Monarkes and Princes, is one with the definition of aking which agreeth to Henry
<pb facs="tcp:3928:320"/> the eight, or to Charles the fifth. So that no more could king Henry as king, meddle with religion, then Alexander or Iulius Cesar. But when we speake of a christian king, we then adde a qualitie of Christianitie to the kingly office. By which qualitie that king is a member of the church of Christ. And according to the place which he hath in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes mysticall body, there after may he worke. His place is chiefe among the laye euen when they are in the church at the seruice of God, and without the church in all temporall thinges and causes he is ouer the priestes them selues.</p>
                  <p>And because all these examples are taken out of the old testament,<note place="margin">VVhat auctoritie had pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estes and kinges by the olde lawe. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.</note> I will geue thee a true resolution out of the same booke, what auctoritie priestes had, and what auctoritie kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges had. Moses gaue this rule concerning the same matter. If (sayeth he) <hi>thou perceiue an hard and doubtfull iudgement to be with thee betwen bloud and bloud, cause and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, lepre and lepre, and seest the wordes of the iudges within thy gates to varie, arise and go vp to the place, which thy Lord God shall chose, and thou shalt come to the priestes of the stocke of Leui, and to the iudge that shall be for the time, and thou shalt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of them, who shall shewe the truth of iudgement to thee. And thou shalt do what soeuer they, who are rulers ouer the place which God shall chose, haue said vnto thee, and taught thee according to his lawe, and thou shalt folow their verdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te. Bowe not neither to the right nor to the left hand.</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto it is shewed, that the Leuiticall priestes and the iudge for the time being shall heare and determine the doubtfull causes. But this hearing and determining may be taken, that either the priest alone heard and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined a mere spirituall controuersie, as whether a disease were the lepre or no, or that the iudge alone determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a mere temporall matter, as what punishment this
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:3928:320"/> or that traitour should haue: or that both together should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine a cause of mixte lawe and iudgement, as in what maner the temple ought to be repayred. But neither the priest by this place may medle with that iurisdiction, which belonged to the temporall iudge, neither the iudge with that which was spirituall and belonging only to the priest. For of such causes Azarias the priest and bishop said to king O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zias, <hi>It is not thy office Ozias to burne incense vnto our Lord.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. <hi>Paral.</hi> 26.</note>
                     <hi>It is the office of the priestes.</hi> That is to saye, of the sonnes of Aaron. Who are consecrated to do such ministeries. But this the king might do euen in matters of religion. When the high priest had geuen sentence, he might see the execution thereof to be done. But otherwise what so euer king or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral iudge might not do in his own persō, much lesse might he iudge, whether an other did well there in or no. And this much concerning the olde testament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Christian Emperours in the olde time,</hi>

                     <hi>appoincted the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of the bishops. Constantine called the councell at Nice, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotius the first, called the councell at Constantinople. Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotius the second, the councell at Ephesus, Martian the councell at Chalcedon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The calling or summoning of councels may be done ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by waye of auctoritie, which the caller him selfe hath,<note place="margin">Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels by their ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne only auctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but by thassent of the bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop of Rome.</note> or by waye of auctoritie, which he taketh of an other. If Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine, the two Theodosians, and Marcian called the foure first generall councels by their auctoritie only, then were they no generall councels. Neither could their decrees binde the whole worlde. For although they were great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, yet was not the whole Christian world vnder them. And therefore those Christian Bisshops who lyued in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia, in Ethiopia, in Scotland, in Scythia, or in any other land not subiect to the Emperour, were neither bound to come, nor bound to obey the lawes made by them, who were not
<pb facs="tcp:3928:321"/> their superiours. But if it be farre from reason that a generall councell should not binde all bishops and all Christians, it is also farre from reason, to saye that Emperours called gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall councels by their owne only auctoritie. In dede they called them by the assent of the bishop of Rome. Who being the generall shepeherd of Christes flocke, and therefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re also of all bishops, might commaund all his shepe to come together, except they were reasonably to be excused, and they were bound to heare his voice, and to obey his decree. So that although ye proued the Emperours to haue summoned and called the foure first councels, yet were ye not able to proue, they did it without the assent of the bishops of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, which for the time sate in Peters chaire. And by the force of that assent the dede must take effecte. And this much ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">S. Sylue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster assen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the calling of the first generall councell.</note>Nowe to proue vnto you, that S. Syluester assented to the calling of the first councell at Nice, it is to be considered, that he only hath auctoritie to ratifie, who hath auctoritie to commaund and to geue assent and strength from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. For none other difference is betwen commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, assenting, auctorizing, and ratifying, but that assenting is common to them all, commaunding is a thing that goeth before the facte, auctorizing is the making of a thing good by present agreeing to it whiles it is done, ratifying is the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of it when is it done. If then I shewe, both that the Pope did ratifie the calling of the generall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,<note place="margin">The sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Popes legates to al coūcels, sheweth an aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing of of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.</note> and auctorize them: I shewe much more that he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the calling of them. The auctorizing is proued, by reason he sent his legates to euery of them. As S. Syluester sent Osius Cordubēsis of the prouince of Spaine vnto Nice with Victor and Vincentius priestes of the citie of Rome. Of which the last two being them selues no bishops, yet for
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:3928:321"/> that they were legates of the chiefe bishop, did in the firste place put vnto the decrees of that councell their consent and names, writing after this sorte. <hi>Pro venerabili viro papa &amp; episcopo nostro Syluestro subscripsimus.

                     <note place="margin">A councel at Rome</note> And at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same time that the generall councell was kept at Nice, S.

So that his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell was necessary, not chiefly for religion, but rather for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of the charges of so great a iourney.

All which councels were kept not only without the presence of the Emperours person, but also without his power or auctoritie. And yet if he were head of the church, it could not haue ben done without him.</p>
                  <p>If you saye he was not then christened, I answere that christianitie is no parte of his Imperiall power.

Therefore Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours were not the holders or kepers of councels the first fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue hundred yeares. Yea three hundred were fully expired, before the Emperour professed openly the christian faith. So much the lesse maye you marueill, that now the bishop
<pb facs="tcp:3928:325"/> of Rome calleth and kepeth councels chieflly by his owne auctoritie. For he succedeth Peter, not Nero. He tooke his auctoritie of Christ immediatly, not of the people of Rome. Be the Emperour Christian, or not Christian, the bishop of Rome by nature of his bishops office, is not only alwayes a christian man, but also a chiefe priest.</p>
                  <p>Where you saye the bishop of Rome in summoning the late councell did besides good consideration, in that he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de a man that is Prince of the whole world, no otherwise partaker thereof,<note place="margin">The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geteth him selfe, or careth litle what he saye.

For who is that whom you call Prince of the whole world? What contradiction is this? Sayd you not in the same sentence before, that kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are nowe fully possessed in the seuerall partes of the whole Empire? How then call you Ferdinande Prince of the whole world? Well this is but one of the common or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namentes of your rhetorike. Syr the Emperour Ferdinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of famous memorie was not so abused of Pius the fourth that blessed man bishop of Rome in these our dayes. Ye rather are they who abuse the Emperours maiestie. For ye depose him cleane from his seate, ye finde fault that euer Leo the third made an Emperour in the West. Ye com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine openly that the Emperiall maiestie had not conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed still at Constantinople. Bylike to the intent the Turke might now haue had it, wko is knowen to suffer in his dominions all faithes, and religions, for which cause it maye seme, ye fauer him. As for Pope Pius that now is, he deferred the olde priuilege of honour vnto the Emperour Ferdinande without the olde burthen. For whereas in olde times Councels were holden by auctoritie of the Pope, as Socrates witnesseth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Li.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> yet the Emperour bare the charge of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:3928:325"/> the bishops together. But now the Pope him selfe bare a great part of that burthen, and communicated his purpose fully with the Emperour.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore ye would, sith that all Christian Princes are nowe come to the possession of the seuerall partes of the Empire, that they also should haue right to call councels.<note place="margin">The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders shoote at is, that there may neuer be any gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell at al.</note> It maye sone be iudged what ye meane by this matter. Ye would that if any Christen Prince would withstande the calling of it in his owne dominiō for his owne part, it should be no generall councell at all. By which meanes it should come to passe, that forasmuch as so many Princes would har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly agree all together, there should neuer lightly be any ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell. Which were a great commoditie for you. For so should your heresies be blasted abrode without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll.</p>

I aunswere nay, that it is not so. For as witnesseth Theodorete, Themperour Constantine sate not only together with them in the Councell at Nice, but gaue also aduice to the Bysshoppes howe it was best to trye out the matter by the Apostles and prophetes writinges, as appeereth by these his own woordes. In disputation (saithe hee) of matters of diuinitie, wee haue sette before vs to followe the doctrine of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye Ghoste.

But the right of calling was all one, when the Pope was most poore. For the sitting of Emperours in councels, you treate a common place not necessarie. No man euer denyed, but Emperours may sitte in them. But we acknowledge two sortes of sitting, one for the assessours, an other for the iudge. No Emperour euer sate as a iudge in Councell,<note place="margin">Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours sitte not in councels as iudges, but as assistēts.</note> but many both Emperours in person and their lieutenauntes for them haue sitten, as being ready to assist and defend that, which the bishops had iudged and decreed.</p>
                  <p>Yea but saye you, Constantine spake and gaue his aduise in the Nicene Councell. Neither that do we denie. But we denie that he was iudge.

The maisters of the chauncerie sitte you knowe, and geue aduise, but the lord Chauncellour iudgeth and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth sentence.

                  <p>Neither consulted he with the bishops, but required them to consult of the matters they came for, as Theodorite wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth.

And after that Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctarius had lerned of Sisinnius a great clerke the best waye to be, if all the heads of ech heresie and sect might be induced to be iudged by the olde fathers and doctours of the church: the godly Emperour hearing this aduise, caused both the heretikes and catholikes also to write ech of them such thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as ech of them had to saye for his belefe. And after pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer made reading ouer all the writinges, he reiected the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, the Macedonians, and the Eunomians, embracing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their sentence, who agreed vpon the consubstantialitie of the sonne of God. Here (saye these Defenders) Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius did not only sitte amongest the bishops, but also ordered the whole arguing of the cause, tearing the papers of the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes,<note place="margin">Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius did not the part of a iudge in cōferring with Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctarius.</note> and allowing the iudgement of the catholikes. To which obiection I make this answere. First that Theodosius
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:3928:327"/> here tooke councell of Nectarius the bishop, and folowed it. Secondely that he intended not to iudge whether opinion of all the sectes were truer, but only sought how to ridde the church of controuersies. Otherwise he would not only haue takē counsel of Nectarius the catholike bishop, but also of the Arians, Macedonians, and Eunomians. For he is not a right iudge, that calleth one side only to him, and in iudgement is ruled by it.</p>
                  <p>If then it be plaine, that the Emperour only consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with catholikes, it is no lesse plaine, that he sate not iudge vpon the catholikes. What did he then? Verely he entended to execute that iudgement, which the bishops had pronounced at Nice, and therefore he conferred only with men of that side. And because he was enstructed, that by disputation no good should come, he chose this waye, to make all to write their opinions. Not that he minded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we to lerne his faith out of their writinges, sith he had lerned that long before, and professed the same in his baptisme: but he sought a waie whereby to put all heretikes to silence. Therefore hauing reade all the writinges, and hauing made his praier to God for grace to chose the better side, which also he made not doubting of his faith (for els he were an infidell and vnworthy to be a iudge euen in the temporall matters amōg Christiās) but partly he declared that al good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is to be asked of God,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iacob.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>cor.</hi> 6.</note> partly he would the heretikes to vnderstād, that he wēt not to worke with affectiō, but with the feare of God. Thus hauing praied and readen the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges, he executed the iudgement of the Nicene councell, and reiected those heretikes. If the Emperour Maximilian would likewise by the counsell of a catholike bishop seeke a waye how to execute with most quiet the Tridentine co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uncell, and how to ende all sectes in Germanie: the Pope
<pb facs="tcp:3928:328"/> will thinke by that fact his auctoritie nowhitte preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.</p>
                  <p>Now to retourne to the wordes of the Apologie, how saye they that <hi>the Emperour not only sate amōg bishops, but also cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sae desceptationi praefuit,</hi>

                  <p>If we shall report the thinge, as it was in truth done, only Theodosius vsed a politike waie to put heretikes to silence.

Anthemius bishop of Constantinople was by the Pope Ioannes condemned for the heresie of Eutyches. For the which Iustinian depriued

After whose death Theodora being a gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at mainteiner of the Entychians, practised with Syluerius who succeded Agapetus, to restore Anthemius the heretike to his bishoprike againe. Which when he had refused to do, she wrote to Capitaine Bellisarius then keping warre for the Emperour against the Gothes, to depose Syluerius, and to set vigilius, with whom she had conferred before for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Anthemius, in the see of Rome. Bellisarius, whether it were for that he was loth in conscience to satisfie her deuilish request, or otherwise encombered with the affai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of warre, committed the whole to Antonina his wife.

                  <p>Vigilius succeded with whom Theodora was instant, that he would come to Constantinople and restore Anthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius. But when he had refused to do it, for that he was an heretike, and iustly deposed, she founde the meanes such thinges should be laid to his charge, as he thought it expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, he went to Constantinople there to cleare him selfe. Being arriued there, and hauing denyed the Emperesse her request touching the restitution of Anthemius, forthwith after much villanie and crueltie done vnto him, he was cast into prison, where a long time he was kept with bread and water, and at length set at libertie at request made for him by the Romaines, and sent home.

Now therefore we answere, it was neuer laufull in any temporall prince to iudge in causes of Religion. Neither did any prince before this tyme euer vse it.</p>
                  <p>If ye require only that princes be made acquainted with these matters, the same in dewe order was neuer denyed. Yea the Pope at this daie maketh princes priuey to them and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of them, as in olde tyme it was wonte to be. And who knoweth not, that our holy father Pius the fourth nowe Pope did to the Emperour Ferdinande that honour, as to send vnto his maiestie from this last councell at Trent, Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Morone being chiefe legate in the same, to conferre with him about the affaires of the church? Yet that conference proueth not, that the Emperour could be iudge in the cause. It was rather to moue him to good execution of the bishops decrees, then to lerne of him, or aske his aduise what should be decreed.</p>
                  <p>Neither haue bishops by their holynes or lerning, that they be iudges, but by their iurisdiction and keyes. They ought to be lerned and holy,<note place="margin">Sith Christ fai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leth not his chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che in thinges necessary, we nede not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust the lack of necessary ministers. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.</note> if some be not, it is their fault: yet some be, and shall be to the worldes ende. For Christ forsaketh not his church, nor faileth in thinges ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, as often times we haue said. Therfore he placeth in his church <hi>some Apostles, some Euangelistes, others prophetes, and other some shepeherdes and teachers, to the edifying of his bodie which is the church, vntill we meete all together in vnitie of faith, that from henceforth we be no more children wauering and caried about with euery winde of doctrine, by the wilynes of men and craftines, whereby they laie awaite for vnto deceiue vs.</hi> All this
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:3928:333"/> requireth good lerning and wisdome, as experience tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth. And therefore, raile ye neuer so much at the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of bishops, the church shall euer haue lerned and wise bisshops. For the word of the holy ghost vttered by S.

For thus know we the<note place="margin">h</note> ould Fathers vsed to putt in experience before they came to the publique vniuersall Councell. There remaine yet at this daye canons writen<note place="margin">i</note> in Councelles of free Cities, as of Carthage vnder Cyprian, as of Ancyra, Neocesaria and of Gangra also whiche is in Paphlagonia as some thinke, before that the name of the generall Councel at Nice was euer heard of. After this fas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiō in olde time did they spedely meet with, and cut short those He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques the Pelagians and the Donatistes at home with priuate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputation, without any generall Councell. Thus also when the Emperour Constantius euidently and earnestly toke part with Auxentius the Byshop of the Arrians faction, Ambrose the Byshop of the Christians appealed not vnto a generall Councell, where he sawe no good could be don, by reason of the Emperours might and great labour, but appealed to his own Cleargie and people, that is to say, to a Prouinciall Synode <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. And thus it was decreed in the Councell at Nice, that the Byshops should assemble twise euery yeare. And in the Councel at Carthage it was decreed, that the Bysshops shoulde meete togeather in eche of their prouinces, at least once in the year, which was done as saith the Councel at Chalcedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, of purpose, that if any errours and abuses had happened to sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge vp any where, they might immediatelye at the first enterie be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed where they firste begonne. So likewise when Secundus and Palladius reiected the Councell at Aquila, because it was not a generall and common Councell, Ambrose bysshoppe of Millaine made aunswere, that no man ought to take it for a newe or straunge matter that the Bysshops of the weste parte of the worlde didde call togeather Synodes, and make priuate assemblies in their Prouinces, for that it was a thing before then vsed by the west Bysshoppes no fewe times, and by the Bysshoppes of Grecia vsed oftentymes and commonly to be done. And so<note place="margin">k</note> Charles the great being Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, held a prouinciall Councell in Germanie, for puttinge awaye Images, contrary to the seconde Councell at Nice. Neither pardy euen amongest vs is this so very a straunge and newe a trade?

Hieromes sense, you make him to speake of the repairing againe of Gods church, as though at this daye it were by default of the catholike clergy fallen downe, and should be set vp againe by you and your ministers, also of the blindnes of the bishops of our time, that they be the maisters by whom the people hath ben lead into errour, and lulled a shepe.

Riches saith Iorome, may make a Byshop to be of more might then the rest: but all the Byshoppes whosoeuer they be, are the Successours of the Apostles. Yf so be the place and consecrating onely be sufficient (why then) Manasses succeded Dauid, and Caiphas succeded Aaron. And it hath ben often seene, that an Idol hath stand in the Temple of God. In old tyme Archidamus the Lacedemonian boasted muche of hym selfe, how he came of the bloud of Hercules, but one Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>costratus in thys wise abated his pryde: Nay, quod he, thou semest not to descende from Hercules, for Hercules destroied yll men, but thou makest good men euill.

                  <p>Gods grace in one respect is promised both to a good minde and to one that feareth God, and also in an other res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,

Hieromes saying to Eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grius, which now you haue alleaged three or foure times, will not handsomly serue you for so diuerse pointes, as a shipmans hose for diuerse legges. Once againe I tell you, thereby he meaneth nothing els, but that, the greatnes of Rome ought not to geue auctoritie to a wronge priuat custome, (by which deacons in certaine cases were prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before priestes) against the right generall custome of the world. And bishops be the successours of the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, we graunt, yet is the Pope the successour of Peter, who was shepeherd of all Christes lambes and shepe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore also of the Apostles them selues, and so hath a higher auctoritie.</p>
                  <p>The place and consecrating only be not ynough,<note place="margin">Euill life taketh not away bishoply auctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> that a bishop erre not. But what so euer bishop is duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated, though he be an euill man: yet is he a bishop, and by lacke of vertuous lyfe, loseth not bishoply auctoritie and power. Iudas as wicked as he was, an apostle he was, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse then Peter, Iohn, or Iames. Manasses also was a king, as well as Dauid, and Caiphas a high bishop, as well as Aaron. Mary betwen God and the idoll ye speake of, there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable difference.</p>
                  <p>As for your example of Archidamus, who boastingly fetched his petigree from Hercules, you must consider, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of vertue alwaies foloweth not succession of bloud. Now we do acknowledge in the Pope a succession of shepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdly power, euen such as was in Peter. Which power is not taken awaie by lacke of Peters holynes.

Iohn Laterane, and poincted out with his finger al the places of Purgatorie, and kyndes of punishementes, committing some poore soules to be tormented, and other some againe sodenlye releasing thence at his owne pleasure, taking money for so doing: or that he gaue order to say priuate Masses in euery corner: or that he mumbled vp the holy seruice with a lowe voice and in an vnknowē lāguage, or that he hāged vp the Sacramēt in eue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry Tēple and on euery aulter, and caried the same about before him whether so euer he wēt, vpō an ambling Iēnet, with lightes, and bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les: or that he consecrated with his holy breath, oyle, waxe, wulle, belles, chaleses, churches and aulters, or that he solde Iubiles, graces, liberties, aduousons, preuentions, first frutes, palles, the wearing of palles, bulles indulgēces and pardōs: or that he called him self by the name of the head of the church, the highest bishop, bishop of bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops, alon most holy: or that by vsurping he tooke vpō him self the right and authoritie ouer other folkes churches: or that he exemted him selfe from the power of any ciuill gouernement: or that he mainteined warres, set Princes together at variaunce: or that he syt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in his chaire with his triple Crowne full of labelles, with sumptuous and Persianlike gorgiousnes, with his Royall scepter, with his Diademe of goulde and glittering with stones, was caried about not vpon Paalfraie, but vpon the shoulders of noble menne. These thinges no doubt did Peter at Rome in times past, and left them in charge to his Successours as you would saye, from hand to hande: for these thinges be now a dayes donne at Rome by the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, and be so done, as though nothing els ought to be done.</hi>

                  <p>Concerning the case betwen these three kinges of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, and the bishops of Rome for the time being, I saye
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:3928:352"/> litle. If they did well, and the bishops euil, they haue their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, the other, their punishement. If otherwise, or how so euer, ech one at Gods iudgement shall haue his deserued measure. But be it graunted, all were true, ye saye, though we know the more part to be false. What though king Henry the second<note place="margin">Henry the second.</note> were euill treated of Pope Alexander about the murthering of S. Thomas the archebishop of Cantorbury,<note place="margin">S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chebishop of Cātor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</note> and king Iohn<note place="margin">Kīg Iohn.</note> likewise of that zelous and lerned Pope In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentius the third, about the stirre he made against the church for cause of Steuen Lankton Archebishop of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torbury, king Henry the eight<note place="margin">Henry the eight.</note> likewise of the Popes in our time about matters yet fresh bleeding? Is this a good cause why ye (who haue nothing to do with Princes matters now ended and buried) should forsake the church,<note place="margin">This is no iust cause to forsake the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che.</note> change your faith, change the whole order of religion, and condemne all before your time for a thousand yeres?</p>
                  <p>Because the bishops of Rome haue done euill, wil ye ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue ouer the faith of the church of Rome? Because the Popes did wrong to Princes, will ye do wrong to your selues? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Popes were at variance with these three kinges, will ye be at variance with God? Because they excommunicated them, will ye excommunicate your selues? I haue hearde of a foole that being striken of one standing a looffe of, would eftsones strike an other that stood next him. But I neuer heard of any so folish, that seing an other striken, would the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore kill him selfe. Verely your Apostasie and departing from the catholike church, is to weighty a matter, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with so light a reason.</p>

                     <hi>they would nedes make all the Realme tributarie to them, and exacted thence yearely most vniust and wrongfull taxes. So deere cost vs the freendeship of the Citie of Rome. Wherefore if they haue gotten these thinges of vs by extortion through their fraude and suttle sleightes, we see
<pb facs="tcp:3928:353"/> no reason why we may not plucke awaye the same from them againe by laufull wayes and iust meanes. And if our kinges in that darknes and blindenes of former times gaue them these thinges of their owne accorde and liberalitie for Religion sake, being moued with a certaine opinion of their fained holynes, now when ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and errour is spied out, may the kinges their successours take them awaye againe, seing they haue the same auctoritie, the Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges their auncestours had before.

                     <hi>Neyther doe wee eschew concorde and peace, but to haue peace with man, wee will not be at warre with God. The name of peace is a swete and pleasaunte thinge, saith Hilarius: But yet beware, sayth he, peace is one thinge, and boundage is an other. For yf it shoulde so be as they seeke to haue it, that Christe should be commaunded to keepe silence, that the truth of the Gospell should be betraied, that horrible errours should be cloked, that Christian mennes eyes should be bleared, and that they might be suffred to conspire o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penlye against God: this were not a peace, but a moste vngodlye couenaunt of seruitude. There is a peace saith Nazianzene, that is vnprofitable: againe there is a discorde saith he, that is profitable. For we muste conditionallye desire peace, so farre as is laufull before God, and so farre as we may conueniently. For otherwise Christ him selfe broughte not peace into the worlde, but a sworde. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Pope wil haue vs recōciled to hym, his dewty is first to be reconciled to God: for from thence saith Cyprian, spring schismes and sectes, bycause menne seeke not the head, and haue not their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:3928:360"/> to the Fountaine of the Scriptures, and kepe not the Rules gyuen by the heauenly teacher: for saith he, that is not peace but warre: neither is he ioyned vnto the Churche which is seuered from the Gospell. As for these men they vse to make a marchandize of the name of peace. For that peace whiche they so faine would haue, is onely a rest of idle bellies. They and we might easily be brought to atonement touching all these matters, were it not that ambition, glutony and excesse did let it: Hence commeth their why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, their hearte is on their Halfe pennye. Out of doubt their clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and stirres be to none other ende, but to maynteine more shamefully and naughtely yll gotten thinges.</hi>

Many a daye a go and in the old worlde, a wonderfull great aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage grew hereby to these kinde of people, but now they recken all is losse vnto them that Christ gaigneth.
